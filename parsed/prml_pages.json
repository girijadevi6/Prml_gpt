    "text": "Preface Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same \ufb01eld, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had signi\ufb01cant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook re\ufb02ects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the \ufb01elds of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or \ufb01rst year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es- sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. Because this book has broad scope, it is impossible to provide a complete list of references, and in particular no attempt has been made to provide accurate historical attribution of ideas. Instead, the aim has been to give references that offer greater detail than is possible here and that hopefully provide entry points into what, in some cases, is a very extensive literature. For this reason, the references are often to more recent textbooks and review articles rather than to original sources. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, including lecture slides as well as the complete set of \ufb01gures used in the book, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information: http://research.microsoft.com/\u223ccmbishop/PRML vii",

    "text": "viii PREFACE Exercises The exercises that appear at the end of every chapter form an important com- ponent of the book. Each exercise has been carefully chosen to reinforce concepts explained in the text or to develop and generalize them in signi\ufb01cant ways, and each is graded according to dif\ufb01culty ranging from (\u22c6), which denotes a simple exercise taking a few minutes to complete, through to (\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6), which denotes a signi\ufb01cantly more complex exercise. It has been dif\ufb01cult to know to what extent these solutions should be made widely available. Those engaged in self study will \ufb01nd worked solutions very ben- e\ufb01cial, whereas many course tutors request that solutions be available only via the publisher so that the exercises may be used in class. In order to try to meet these con\ufb02icting requirements, those exercises that help amplify key points in the text, or that \ufb01ll in important details, have solutions that are available as a PDF \ufb01le from the book web site. Such exercises are denoted by www . Solutions for the remaining exercises are available to course tutors by contacting the publisher (contact details are given on the book web site). Readers are strongly encouraged to work through the exercises unaided, and to turn to the solutions only as required. Although this book focuses on concepts and principles, in a taught course the students should ideally have the opportunity to experiment with some of the key algorithms using appropriate data sets. A companion volume (Bishop and Nabney, 2008) will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will be accompanied by Matlab software implementing most of the algorithms discussed in this book. Acknowledgements First of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Markus Svens\u00b4en who has provided immense help with preparation of \ufb01gures and with the typesetting of the book in LATEX. His assistance has been invaluable. I am very grateful to Microsoft Research for providing a highly stimulating re- search environment and for giving me the freedom to write this book (the views and opinions expressed in this book, however, are my own and are therefore not neces- sarily the same as those of Microsoft or its af\ufb01liates). Springer has provided excellent support throughout the \ufb01nal stages of prepara- tion of this book, and I would like to thank my commissioning editor John Kimmel for his support and professionalism, as well as Joseph Piliero for his help in design- ing the cover and the text format and MaryAnn Brickner for her numerous contribu- tions during the production phase. The inspiration for the cover design came from a discussion with Antonio Criminisi. I also wish to thank Oxford University Press for permission to reproduce ex- cerpts from an earlier textbook, Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition (Bishop, 1995a). The images of the Mark 1 perceptron and of Frank Rosenblatt are repro- duced with the permission of Arvin Calspan Advanced Technology Center. I would also like to thank Asela Gunawardana for plotting the spectrogram in Figure 13.1, and Bernhard Sch\u00a8olkopf for permission to use his kernel PCA code to plot Fig- ure 12.17.",

    "text": "Mathematical notation I have tried to keep the mathematical content of the book to the minimum neces- sary to achieve a proper understanding of the \ufb01eld. However, this minimum level is nonzero, and it should be emphasized that a good grasp of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is essential for a clear understanding of modern pattern recog- nition and machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the emphasis in this book is on conveying the underlying concepts rather than on mathematical rigour. I have tried to use a consistent notation throughout the book, although at times this means departing from some of the conventions used in the corresponding re- search literature. Vectors are denoted by lower case bold Roman letters such as x, and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. A superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector, so that xT will be a row vector. Uppercase bold roman letters, such as M, denote matrices. The notation (w1, . . . , wM) denotes a row vector with M elements, while the corresponding column vector is written as w = (w1, . . . , wM)T. The notation [a, b] is used to denote the closed interval from a to b, that is the interval including the values a and b themselves, while (a, b) denotes the correspond- ing open interval, that is the interval excluding a and b. Similarly, [a, b) denotes an interval that includes a but excludes b. For the most part, however, there will be little need to dwell on such re\ufb01nements as whether the end points of an interval are included or not. The M \u00d7 M identity matrix (also known as the unit matrix) is denoted IM, which will be abbreviated to I where there is no ambiguity about it dimensionality. It has elements Iij that equal 1 if i = j and 0 if i \u0338= j. A functional is denoted f[y] where y(x) is some function. The concept of a functional is discussed in Appendix D. The notation g(x) = O(f(x)) denotes that |f(x)/g(x)| is bounded as x \u2192\u221e. For instance if g(x) = 3x2 + 2, then g(x) = O(x2). The expectation of a function f(x, y) with respect to a random variable x is de- noted by Ex[f(x, y)]. In situations where there is no ambiguity as to which variable is being averaged over, this will be simpli\ufb01ed by omitting the suf\ufb01x, for instance xi",

    "text": "xii MATHEMATICAL NOTATION E[x]. If the distribution of x is conditioned on another variable z, then the corre- sponding conditional expectation will be written Ex[f(x)|z]. Similarly, the variance is denoted var[f(x)], and for vector variables the covariance is written cov[x, y]. We shall also use cov[x] as a shorthand notation for cov[x, x]. The concepts of expecta- tions and covariances are introduced in Section 1.2.2. If we have N values x1, . . . , xN of a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T, we can combine the observations into a data matrix X in which the nth row of X corresponds to the row vector xT n. Thus the n, i element of X corresponds to the ith element of the nth observation xn. For the case of one-dimensional variables we shall denote such a matrix by x, which is a column vector whose nth element is xn. Note that x (which has dimensionality N) uses a different typeface to distinguish it from x (which has dimensionality D).",

    "text": "1 Introduction The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has a long and successful history. For instance, the extensive astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe in the 16th century allowed Johannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of planetary motion, which in turn provided a springboard for the development of clas- sical mechanics. Similarly, the discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a key role in the development and veri\ufb01cation of quantum physics in the early twenti- eth century. The \ufb01eld of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discov- ery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories. Consider the example of recognizing handwritten digits, illustrated in Figure 1.1. Each digit corresponds to a 28\u00d728 pixel image and so can be represented by a vector x comprising 784 real numbers. The goal is to build a machine that will take such a vector x as input and that will produce the identity of the digit 0, . . . , 9 as the output. This is a nontrivial problem due to the wide variability of handwriting. It could be 1",

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.1 Examples of hand-written dig- its taken from US zip codes. tackled using handcrafted rules or heuristics for distinguishing the digits based on the shapes of the strokes, but in practice such an approach leads to a proliferation of rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on, and invariably gives poor results. Far better results can be obtained by adopting a machine learning approach in which a large set of N digits {x1, . . . , xN} called a training set is used to tune the parameters of an adaptive model. The categories of the digits in the training set are known in advance, typically by inspecting them individually and hand-labelling them. We can express the category of a digit using target vector t, which represents the identity of the corresponding digit. Suitable techniques for representing cate- gories in terms of vectors will be discussed later. Note that there is one such target vector t for each digit image x. The result of running the machine learning algorithm can be expressed as a function y(x) which takes a new digit image x as input and that generates an output vector y, encoded in the same way as the target vectors. The precise form of the function y(x) is determined during the training phase, also known as the learning phase, on the basis of the training data. Once the model is trained it can then de- termine the identity of new digit images, which are said to comprise a test set. The ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for train- ing is known as generalization. In practical applications, the variability of the input vectors will be such that the training data can comprise only a tiny fraction of all possible input vectors, and so generalization is a central goal in pattern recognition. For most practical applications, the original input variables are typically prepro- cessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve. For instance, in the digit recogni- tion problem, the images of the digits are typically translated and scaled so that each digit is contained within a box of a \ufb01xed size. This greatly reduces the variability within each digit class, because the location and scale of all the digits are now the same, which makes it much easier for a subsequent pattern recognition algorithm to distinguish between the different classes. This pre-processing stage is sometimes also called feature extraction. Note that new test data must be pre-processed using the same steps as the training data. Pre-processing might also be performed in order to speed up computation. For example, if the goal is real-time face detection in a high-resolution video stream, the computer must handle huge numbers of pixels per second, and presenting these directly to a complex pattern recognition algorithm may be computationally infeasi- ble. Instead, the aim is to \ufb01nd useful features that are fast to compute, and yet that",

    "text": "1. INTRODUCTION 3 also preserve useful discriminatory information enabling faces to be distinguished from non-faces. These features are then used as the inputs to the pattern recognition algorithm. For instance, the average value of the image intensity over a rectangular subregion can be evaluated extremely ef\ufb01ciently (Viola and Jones, 2004), and a set of such features can prove very effective in fast face detection. Because the number of such features is smaller than the number of pixels, this kind of pre-processing repre- sents a form of dimensionality reduction. Care must be taken during pre-processing because often information is discarded, and if this information is important to the solution of the problem then the overall accuracy of the system can suffer. Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning prob- lems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a \ufb01nite number of discrete categories, are called classi\ufb01cation problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the pre- diction of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist of the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure. In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization. Finally, the technique of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is con- cerned with the problem of \ufb01nding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by a process of trial and error. Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment. In many cases, the current action not only affects the immediate reward but also has an impact on the re- ward at all subsequent time steps. For example, by using appropriate reinforcement learning techniques a neural network can learn to play the game of backgammon to a high standard (Tesauro, 1994). Here the network must learn to take a board position as input, along with the result of a dice throw, and produce a strong move as the output. This is done by having the network play against a copy of itself for perhaps a million games. A major challenge is that a game of backgammon can involve dozens of moves, and yet it is only at the end of the game that the reward, in the form of victory, is achieved. The reward must then be attributed appropriately to all of the moves that led to it, even though some moves will have been good ones and others less so. This is an example of a credit assignment problem. A general feature of re- inforcement learning is the trade-off between exploration, in which the system tries out new kinds of actions to see how effective they are, and exploitation, in which the system makes use of actions that are known to yield a high reward. Too strong a focus on either exploration or exploitation will yield poor results. Reinforcement learning continues to be an active area of machine learning research. However, a",

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.2 Plot of a training data set of N = 10 points, shown as blue circles, each comprising an observation of the input variable x along with the corresponding target variable t. The green curve shows the function sin(2\u03c0x) used to gener- ate the data. Our goal is to pre- dict the value of t for some new value of x, without knowledge of the green curve. x t 0 1 \u22121 0 1 detailed treatment lies beyond the scope of this book. Although each of these tasks needs its own tools and techniques, many of the key ideas that underpin them are common to all such problems. One of the main goals of this chapter is to introduce, in a relatively informal way, several of the most important of these concepts and to illustrate them using simple examples. Later in the book we shall see these same ideas re-emerge in the context of more sophisti- cated models that are applicable to real-world pattern recognition applications. This chapter also provides a self-contained introduction to three important tools that will be used throughout the book, namely probability theory, decision theory, and infor- mation theory. Although these might sound like daunting topics, they are in fact straightforward, and a clear understanding of them is essential if machine learning techniques are to be used to best effect in practical applications. 1.1. Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting We begin by introducing a simple regression problem, which we shall use as a run- ning example throughout this chapter to motivate a number of key concepts. Sup- pose we observe a real-valued input variable x and we wish to use this observation to predict the value of a real-valued target variable t. For the present purposes, it is in- structive to consider an arti\ufb01cial example using synthetically generated data because we then know the precise process that generated the data for comparison against any learned model. The data for this example is generated from the function sin(2\u03c0x) with random noise included in the target values, as described in detail in Appendix A. Now suppose that we are given a training set comprising N observations of x, written x \u2261(x1, . . . , xN)T, together with corresponding observations of the values of t, denoted t \u2261(t1, . . . , tN)T. Figure 1.2 shows a plot of a training set comprising N = 10 data points. The input data set x in Figure 1.2 was generated by choos- ing values of xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, spaced uniformly in range [0, 1], and the target data set t was obtained by \ufb01rst computing the corresponding values of the function",

Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting 5 sin(2\u03c0x) and then adding a small level of random noise having a Gaussian distri- bution (the Gaussian distribution is discussed in Section 1.2.4) to each such point in order to obtain the corresponding value tn. By generating data in this way, we are capturing a property of many real data sets, namely that they possess an underlying regularity, which we wish to learn, but that individual observations are corrupted by random noise. This noise might arise from intrinsically stochastic (i.e. random) pro- cesses such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to there being sources of variability that are themselves unobserved. Our goal is to exploit this training set in order to make predictions of the value \u0001t of the target variable for some new value \u0001x of the input variable. As we shall see later, this involves implicitly trying to discover the underlying function sin(2\u03c0x). This is intrinsically a dif\ufb01cult problem as we have to generalize from a \ufb01nite data set. Furthermore the observed data are corrupted with noise, and so for a given \u0001x there is uncertainty as to the appropriate value for \u0001t. Probability theory, discussed in Section 1.2, provides a framework for expressing such uncertainty in a precise and quantitative manner, and decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, allows us to exploit this probabilistic representation in order to make predictions that are optimal according to appropriate criteria. For the moment, however, we shall proceed rather informally and consider a simple approach based on curve \ufb01tting. In particular, we shall \ufb01t the data using a polynomial function of the form y(x, w) = w0 + w1x + w2x2 + . . . + wMxM = M \u0002 j=0 wjxj (1.1) where M is the order of the polynomial, and xj denotes x raised to the power of j. The polynomial coef\ufb01cients w0, . . . , wM are collectively denoted by the vector w. Note that, although the polynomial function y(x, w) is a nonlinear function of x, it is a linear function of the coef\ufb01cients w. Functions, such as the polynomial, which are linear in the unknown parameters have important properties and are called linear models and will be discussed extensively in Chapters 3 and 4. The values of the coef\ufb01cients will be determined by \ufb01tting the polynomial to the training data. This can be done by minimizing an error function that measures the mis\ufb01t between the function y(x, w), for any given value of w, and the training set data points. One simple choice of error function, which is widely used, is given by the sum of the squares of the errors between the predictions y(xn, w) for each data point xn and the corresponding target values tn, so that we minimize E(w) = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, w) \u2212tn}2 (1.2) where the factor of 1/2 is included for later convenience. We shall discuss the mo- tivation for this choice of error function later in this chapter. For the moment we simply note that it is a nonnegative quantity that would be zero if, and only if, the",

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.3 The error function (1.2) corre- sponds to (one half of) the sum of the squares of the displacements (shown by the vertical green bars) of each data point from the function y(x, w). t x y(xn, w) tn xn function y(x, w) were to pass exactly through each training data point. The geomet- rical interpretation of the sum-of-squares error function is illustrated in Figure 1.3. We can solve the curve \ufb01tting problem by choosing the value of w for which E(w) is as small as possible. Because the error function is a quadratic function of the coef\ufb01cients w, its derivatives with respect to the coef\ufb01cients will be linear in the elements of w, and so the minimization of the error function has a unique solution, denoted by w\u22c6, which can be found in closed form. The resulting polynomial is Exercise 1.1 given by the function y(x, w\u22c6). There remains the problem of choosing the order M of the polynomial, and as we shall see this will turn out to be an example of an important concept called model comparison or model selection. In Figure 1.4, we show four examples of the results of \ufb01tting polynomials having orders M = 0, 1, 3, and 9 to the data set shown in Figure 1.2. We notice that the constant (M = 0) and \ufb01rst order (M = 1) polynomials give rather poor \ufb01ts to the data and consequently rather poor representations of the function sin(2\u03c0x). The third order (M = 3) polynomial seems to give the best \ufb01t to the function sin(2\u03c0x) of the examples shown in Figure 1.4. When we go to a much higher order polynomial (M = 9), we obtain an excellent \ufb01t to the training data. In fact, the polynomial passes exactly through each data point and E(w\u22c6) = 0. However, the \ufb01tted curve oscillates wildly and gives a very poor representation of the function sin(2\u03c0x). This latter behaviour is known as over-\ufb01tting. As we have noted earlier, the goal is to achieve good generalization by making accurate predictions for new data. We can obtain some quantitative insight into the dependence of the generalization performance on M by considering a separate test set comprising 100 data points generated using exactly the same procedure used to generate the training set points but with new choices for the random noise values included in the target values. For each choice of M, we can then evaluate the residual value of E(w\u22c6) given by (1.2) for the training data, and we can also evaluate E(w\u22c6) for the test data set. It is sometimes more convenient to use the root-mean-square",

However, the test set error has become very large and, as we saw in Figure 1.4, the corresponding function y(x, w\u22c6) exhibits wild oscillations. This may seem paradoxical because a polynomial of given order contains all lower order polynomials as special cases. The M = 9 polynomial is therefore capa- ble of generating results at least as good as the M = 3 polynomial. Furthermore, we might suppose that the best predictor of new data would be the function sin(2\u03c0x) from which the data was generated (and we shall see later that this is indeed the case). We know that a power series expansion of the function sin(2\u03c0x) contains terms of all orders, so we might expect that results should improve monotonically as we increase M. We can gain some insight into the problem by examining the values of the co- ef\ufb01cients w\u22c6obtained from polynomials of various order, as shown in Table 1.1. We see that, as M increases, the magnitude of the coef\ufb01cients typically gets larger.

We see that increasing the size of the data set reduces the over-\ufb01tting problem. ing polynomial function matches each of the data points exactly, but between data points (particularly near the ends of the range) the function exhibits the large oscilla- tions observed in Figure 1.4. Intuitively, what is happening is that the more \ufb02exible polynomials with larger values of M are becoming increasingly tuned to the random noise on the target values. It is also interesting to examine the behaviour of a given model as the size of the data set is varied, as shown in Figure 1.6. We see that, for a given model complexity, the over-\ufb01tting problem become less severe as the size of the data set increases. Another way to say this is that the larger the data set, the more complex (in other words more \ufb02exible) the model that we can afford to \ufb01t to the data. One rough heuristic that is sometimes advocated is that the number of data points should be no less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of adaptive parameters in the model. However, as we shall see in Chapter 3, the number of parameters is not necessarily the most appropriate measure of model complexity. Also, there is something rather unsatisfying about having to limit the number of parameters in a model according to the size of the available training set. It would seem more reasonable to choose the complexity of the model according to the com- plexity of the problem being solved. We shall see that the least squares approach to \ufb01nding the model parameters represents a speci\ufb01c case of maximum likelihood (discussed in Section 1.2.5), and that the over-\ufb01tting problem can be understood as a general property of maximum likelihood. By adopting a Bayesian approach, the Section 3.4 over-\ufb01tting problem can be avoided. We shall see that there is no dif\ufb01culty from a Bayesian perspective in employing models for which the number of parameters greatly exceeds the number of data points. Indeed, in a Bayesian model the effective number of parameters adapts automatically to the size of the data set. For the moment, however, it is instructive to continue with the current approach and to consider how in practice we can apply it to data sets of limited size where we",

One technique that is often used to control the over-\ufb01tting phenomenon in such cases is that of regularization, which involves adding a penalty term to the error function (1.2) in order to discourage the coef\ufb01cients from reaching large values. The simplest such penalty term takes the form of a sum of squares of all of the coef\ufb01cients, leading to a modi\ufb01ed error function of the form \u0004E(w) = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, w) \u2212tn}2 + \u03bb 2 \u2225w\u22252 (1.4) where \u2225w\u22252 \u2261wTw = w2 0 + w2 1 + . . . + w2 M, and the coef\ufb01cient \u03bb governs the rel- ative importance of the regularization term compared with the sum-of-squares error term. Note that often the coef\ufb01cient w0 is omitted from the regularizer because its inclusion causes the results to depend on the choice of origin for the target variable (Hastie et al., 2001), or it may be included but with its own regularization coef\ufb01cient (we shall discuss this topic in more detail in Section 5.5.1). Again, the error function in (1.4) can be minimized exactly in closed form. Techniques such as this are known Exercise 1.2 in the statistics literature as shrinkage methods because they reduce the value of the coef\ufb01cients. The particular case of a quadratic regularizer is called ridge regres- sion (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970). In the context of neural networks, this approach is known as weight decay. Figure 1.7 shows the results of \ufb01tting the polynomial of order M = 9 to the same data set as before but now using the regularized error function given by (1.4). We see that, for a value of ln \u03bb = \u221218, the over-\ufb01tting has been suppressed and we now obtain a much closer representation of the underlying function sin(2\u03c0x). If, however, we use too large a value for \u03bb then we again obtain a poor \ufb01t, as shown in Figure 1.7 for ln \u03bb = 0. The corresponding coef\ufb01cients from the \ufb01tted polynomials are given in Table 1.2, showing that regularization has the desired effect of reducing",

We see that in effect \u03bb now controls the effective complexity of the model and hence determines the degree of over-\ufb01tting. The issue of model complexity is an important one and will be discussed at length in Section 1.3. Here we simply note that, if we were trying to solve a practical application using this approach of minimizing an error function, we would have to \ufb01nd a way to determine a suitable value for the model complexity. The results above suggest a simple way of achieving this, namely by taking the available data and partitioning it into a training set, used to determine the coef\ufb01cients w, and a separate validation set, also called a hold-out set, used to optimize the model complexity (either M or \u03bb). In many cases, however, this will prove to be too wasteful of valuable training data, and we have to seek more sophisticated approaches. Section 1.3 So far our discussion of polynomial curve \ufb01tting has appealed largely to in- tuition. We now seek a more principled approach to solving problems in pattern recognition by turning to a discussion of probability theory.

INTRODUCTION give us some important insights into the concepts we have introduced in the con- text of polynomial curve \ufb01tting and will allow us to extend these to more complex situations. 1.2. Probability Theory A key concept in the \ufb01eld of pattern recognition is that of uncertainty. It arises both through noise on measurements, as well as through the \ufb01nite size of data sets. Prob- ability theory provides a consistent framework for the quanti\ufb01cation and manipula- tion of uncertainty and forms one of the central foundations for pattern recognition. When combined with decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, it allows us to make optimal predictions given all the information available to us, even though that infor- mation may be incomplete or ambiguous. We will introduce the basic concepts of probability theory by considering a sim- ple example. Imagine we have two boxes, one red and one blue, and in the red box we have 2 apples and 6 oranges, and in the blue box we have 3 apples and 1 orange. This is illustrated in Figure 1.9. Now suppose we randomly pick one of the boxes and from that box we randomly select an item of fruit, and having observed which sort of fruit it is we replace it in the box from which it came. We could imagine repeating this process many times. Let us suppose that in so doing we pick the red box 40% of the time and we pick the blue box 60% of the time, and that when we remove an item of fruit from a box we are equally likely to select any of the pieces of fruit in the box. In this example, the identity of the box that will be chosen is a random variable, which we shall denote by B. This random variable can take one of two possible values, namely r (corresponding to the red box) or b (corresponding to the blue box). Similarly, the identity of the fruit is also a random variable and will be denoted by F. It can take either of the values a (for apple) or o (for orange). To begin with, we shall de\ufb01ne the probability of an event to be the fraction of times that event occurs out of the total number of trials, in the limit that the total number of trials goes to in\ufb01nity. Thus the probability of selecting the red box is 4/10 Figure 1.9 We use a simple example of two coloured boxes each containing fruit (apples shown in green and or- anges shown in orange) to intro- duce the basic ideas of probability.",

In this illustration we have M = 5 and L = 3. If we consider a total number N of instances of these variables, then we denote the number of instances where X = xi and Y = yj by nij, which is the number of points in the corresponding cell of the array.

We write these probabilities as p(B = r) = 4/10 and p(B = b) = 6/10. Note that, by de\ufb01nition, probabilities must lie in the interval [0, 1]. Also, if the events are mutually exclusive and if they include all possible outcomes (for instance, in this example the box must be either red or blue), then we see that the probabilities for those events must sum to one. We can now ask questions such as: \u201cwhat is the overall probability that the se- lection procedure will pick an apple?\u201d, or \u201cgiven that we have chosen an orange, what is the probability that the box we chose was the blue one?\u201d. We can answer questions such as these, and indeed much more complex questions associated with problems in pattern recognition, once we have equipped ourselves with the two el- ementary rules of probability, known as the sum rule and the product rule. Having obtained these rules, we shall then return to our boxes of fruit example. In order to derive the rules of probability, consider the slightly more general ex- ample shown in Figure 1.10 involving two random variables X and Y (which could for instance be the Box and Fruit variables considered above). We shall suppose that X can take any of the values xi where i = 1, . . . , M, and Y can take the values yj where j = 1, . . . , L. Consider a total of N trials in which we sample both of the variables X and Y , and let the number of such trials in which X = xi and Y = yj be nij. Also, let the number of trials in which X takes the value xi (irrespective of the value that Y takes) be denoted by ci, and similarly let the number of trials in which Y takes the value yj be denoted by rj. The probability that X will take the value xi and Y will take the value yj is written p(X = xi, Y = yj) and is called the joint probability of X = xi and Y = yj. It is given by the number of points falling in the cell i,j as a fraction of the total number of points, and hence p(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij N . (1.5) Here we are implicitly considering the limit N \u2192\u221e. Similarly, the probability that X takes the value xi irrespective of the value of Y is written as p(X = xi) and is given by the fraction of the total number of points that fall in column i, so that p(X = xi) = ci N .

Note that p(X = xi) is sometimes called the marginal probability, because it is obtained by marginalizing, or summing out, the other variables (in this case Y ). If we consider only those instances for which X = xi, then the fraction of such instances for which Y = yj is written p(Y = yj|X = xi) and is called the conditional probability of Y = yj given X = xi. It is obtained by \ufb01nding the fraction of those points in column i that fall in cell i,j and hence is given by p(Y = yj|X = xi) = nij ci . (1.8) From (1.5), (1.6), and (1.8), we can then derive the following relationship p(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij N = nij ci \u00b7 ci N = p(Y = yj|X = xi)p(X = xi) (1.9) which is the product rule of probability. So far we have been quite careful to make a distinction between a random vari- able, such as the box B in the fruit example, and the values that the random variable can take, for example r if the box were the red one. Thus the probability that B takes the value r is denoted p(B = r). Although this helps to avoid ambiguity, it leads to a rather cumbersome notation, and in many cases there will be no need for such pedantry. Instead, we may simply write p(B) to denote a distribution over the ran- dom variable B, or p(r) to denote the distribution evaluated for the particular value r, provided that the interpretation is clear from the context. With this more compact notation, we can write the two fundamental rules of probability theory in the following form. The Rules of Probability sum rule p(X) = \u0002 Y p(X, Y ) (1.10) product rule p(X, Y ) = p(Y |X)p(X).

From the product rule, together with the symmetry property p(X, Y ) = p(Y, X), we immediately obtain the following relationship between conditional probabilities p(Y |X) = p(X|Y )p(Y ) p(X) (1.12) which is called Bayes\u2019 theorem and which plays a central role in pattern recognition and machine learning. Using the sum rule, the denominator in Bayes\u2019 theorem can be expressed in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator p(X) = \u0002 Y p(X|Y )p(Y ). (1.13) We can view the denominator in Bayes\u2019 theorem as being the normalization constant required to ensure that the sum of the conditional probability on the left-hand side of (1.12) over all values of Y equals one. In Figure 1.11, we show a simple example involving a joint distribution over two variables to illustrate the concept of marginal and conditional distributions.

Modelling distributions from data lies at the heart of statistical pattern recognition and will be explored in great detail in this book. The remaining two plots in Figure 1.11 show the corresponding histogram estimates of p(X) and p(X|Y = 1). Let us now return to our example involving boxes of fruit. For the moment, we shall once again be explicit about distinguishing between the random variables and their instantiations. We have seen that the probabilities of selecting either the red or the blue boxes are given by p(B = r) = 4/10 (1.14) p(B = b) = 6/10 (1.15) respectively. Note that these satisfy p(B = r) + p(B = b) = 1. Now suppose that we pick a box at random, and it turns out to be the blue box. Then the probability of selecting an apple is just the fraction of apples in the blue box which is 3/4, and so p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4. In fact, we can write out all four conditional probabilities for the type of fruit, given the selected box p(F = a|B = r) = 1/4 (1.16) p(F = o|B = r) = 3/4 (1.17) p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4 (1.18) p(F = o|B = b) = 1/4.

    "text": "1.2. Probability Theory 17 Suppose instead we are told that a piece of fruit has been selected and it is an orange, and we would like to know which box it came from. This requires that we evaluate the probability distribution over boxes conditioned on the identity of the fruit, whereas the probabilities in (1.16)\u2013(1.19) give the probability distribution over the fruit conditioned on the identity of the box. We can solve the problem of reversing the conditional probability by using Bayes\u2019 theorem to give p(B = r|F = o) = p(F = o|B = r)p(B = r) p(F = o) = 3 4 \u00d7 4 10 \u00d7 20 9 = 2 3. (1.23) From the sum rule, it then follows that p(B = b|F = o) = 1 \u22122/3 = 1/3. We can provide an important interpretation of Bayes\u2019 theorem as follows. If we had been asked which box had been chosen before being told the identity of the selected item of fruit, then the most complete information we have available is provided by the probability p(B). We call this the prior probability because it is the probability available before we observe the identity of the fruit. Once we are told that the fruit is an orange, we can then use Bayes\u2019 theorem to compute the probability p(B|F), which we shall call the posterior probability because it is the probability obtained after we have observed F. Note that in this example, the prior probability of selecting the red box was 4/10, so that we were more likely to select the blue box than the red one. However, once we have observed that the piece of selected fruit is an orange, we \ufb01nd that the posterior probability of the red box is now 2/3, so that it is now more likely that the box we selected was in fact the red one. This result accords with our intuition, as the proportion of oranges is much higher in the red box than it is in the blue box, and so the observation that the fruit was an orange provides signi\ufb01cant evidence favouring the red box. In fact, the evidence is suf\ufb01ciently strong that it outweighs the prior and makes it more likely that the red box was chosen rather than the blue one. Finally, we note that if the joint distribution of two variables factorizes into the product of the marginals, so that p(X, Y ) = p(X)p(Y ), then X and Y are said to be independent. From the product rule, we see that p(Y |X) = p(Y ), and so the conditional distribution of Y given X is indeed independent of the value of X. For instance, in our boxes of fruit example, if each box contained the same fraction of apples and oranges, then p(F|B) = P(F), so that the probability of selecting, say, an apple is independent of which box is chosen. 1.2.1 Probability densities As well as considering probabilities de\ufb01ned over discrete sets of events, we also wish to consider probabilities with respect to continuous variables. We shall limit ourselves to a relatively informal discussion. If the probability of a real-valued variable x falling in the interval (x, x + \u03b4x) is given by p(x)\u03b4x for \u03b4x \u21920, then p(x) is called the probability density over x. This is illustrated in Figure 1.12. The probability that x will lie in an interval (a, b) is then given by p(x \u2208(a, b)) = \u0006 b a p(x) dx. (1.24)",

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.12 The concept of probability for discrete variables can be ex- tended to that of a probability density p(x) over a continuous variable x and is such that the probability of x lying in the inter- val (x, x+\u03b4x) is given by p(x)\u03b4x for \u03b4x \u21920. The probability density can be expressed as the derivative of a cumulative distri- bution function P(x). x \u03b4x p(x) P(x) Because probabilities are nonnegative, and because the value of x must lie some- where on the real axis, the probability density p(x) must satisfy the two conditions p(x) \u2a7e 0 (1.25) \u0006 \u221e \u2212\u221e p(x) dx = 1. (1.26) Under a nonlinear change of variable, a probability density transforms differently from a simple function, due to the Jacobian factor. For instance, if we consider a change of variables x = g(y), then a function f(x) becomes \u0004f(y) = f(g(y)). Now consider a probability density px(x) that corresponds to a density py(y) with respect to the new variable y, where the suf\ufb01ces denote the fact that px(x) and py(y) are different densities. Observations falling in the range (x, x + \u03b4x) will, for small values of \u03b4x, be transformed into the range (y, y + \u03b4y) where px(x)\u03b4x \u2243py(y)\u03b4y, and hence py(y) = px(x) \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 dx dy \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 = px(g(y)) |g\u2032(y)| . (1.27) One consequence of this property is that the concept of the maximum of a probability density is dependent on the choice of variable. Exercise 1.4 The probability that x lies in the interval (\u2212\u221e, z) is given by the cumulative distribution function de\ufb01ned by P(z) = \u0006 z \u2212\u221e p(x) dx (1.28) which satis\ufb01es P \u2032(x) = p(x), as shown in Figure 1.12.

This multivariate probability density must satisfy p(x) \u2a7e 0 (1.29) \u0006 p(x) dx = 1 (1.30) in which the integral is taken over the whole of x space. We can also consider joint probability distributions over a combination of discrete and continuous variables. Note that if x is a discrete variable, then p(x) is sometimes called a probability mass function because it can be regarded as a set of \u2018probability masses\u2019 concentrated at the allowed values of x. The sum and product rules of probability, as well as Bayes\u2019 theorem, apply equally to the case of probability densities, or to combinations of discrete and con- tinuous variables. For instance, if x and y are two real variables, then the sum and product rules take the form p(x) = \u0006 p(x, y) dy (1.31) p(x, y) = p(y|x)p(x). (1.32) A formal justi\ufb01cation of the sum and product rules for continuous variables (Feller, 1966) requires a branch of mathematics called measure theory and lies outside the scope of this book. Its validity can be seen informally, however, by dividing each real variable into intervals of width \u2206and considering the discrete probability dis- tribution over these intervals. Taking the limit \u2206\u21920 then turns sums into integrals and gives the desired result. 1.2.2 Expectations and covariances One of the most important operations involving probabilities is that of \ufb01nding weighted averages of functions. The average value of some function f(x) under a probability distribution p(x) is called the expectation of f(x) and will be denoted by E[f]. For a discrete distribution, it is given by E[f] = \u0002 x p(x)f(x) (1.33) so that the average is weighted by the relative probabilities of the different values of x. In the case of continuous variables, expectations are expressed in terms of an integration with respect to the corresponding probability density E[f] = \u0006 p(x)f(x) dx. (1.34) In either case, if we are given a \ufb01nite number N of points drawn from the probability distribution or probability density, then the expectation can be approximated as a",

The approximation in (1.35) becomes exact in the limit N \u2192\u221e. Sometimes we will be considering expectations of functions of several variables, in which case we can use a subscript to indicate which variable is being averaged over, so that for instance Ex[f(x, y)] (1.36) denotes the average of the function f(x, y) with respect to the distribution of x. Note that Ex[f(x, y)] will be a function of y. We can also consider a conditional expectation with respect to a conditional distribution, so that Ex[f|y] = \u0002 x p(x|y)f(x) (1.37) with an analogous de\ufb01nition for continuous variables. The variance of f(x) is de\ufb01ned by var[f] = E \b (f(x) \u2212E[f(x)])2 (1.38) and provides a measure of how much variability there is in f(x) around its mean value E[f(x)]. Expanding out the square, we see that the variance can also be written in terms of the expectations of f(x) and f(x)2 Exercise 1.5 var[f] = E[f(x)2] \u2212E[f(x)]2. (1.39) In particular, we can consider the variance of the variable x itself, which is given by var[x] = E[x2] \u2212E[x]2. (1.40) For two random variables x and y, the covariance is de\ufb01ned by cov[x, y] = Ex,y [{x \u2212E[x]} {y \u2212E[y]}] = Ex,y[xy] \u2212E[x]E[y] (1.41) which expresses the extent to which x and y vary together. If x and y are indepen- dent, then their covariance vanishes.

    "text": "1.2. Probability Theory 21 1.2.3 Bayesian probabilities So far in this chapter, we have viewed probabilities in terms of the frequencies of random, repeatable events. We shall refer to this as the classical or frequentist interpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in which probabilities provide a quanti\ufb01cation of uncertainty. Consider an uncertain event, for example whether the moon was once in its own orbit around the sun, or whether the Arctic ice cap will have disappeared by the end of the century. These are not events that can be repeated numerous times in order to de\ufb01ne a notion of probability as we did earlier in the context of boxes of fruit. Nevertheless, we will generally have some idea, for example, of how quickly we think the polar ice is melting. If we now obtain fresh evidence, for instance from a new Earth observation satellite gathering novel forms of diagnostic information, we may revise our opinion on the rate of ice loss. Our assessment of such matters will affect the actions we take, for instance the extent to which we endeavour to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. In such circumstances, we would like to be able to quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of uncertainty in the light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions or decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very general, Bayesian interpretation of probability. The use of probability to represent uncertainty, however, is not an ad-hoc choice, but is inevitable if we are to respect common sense while making rational coherent inferences. For instance, Cox (1946) showed that if numerical values are used to represent degrees of belief, then a simple set of axioms encoding common sense properties of such beliefs leads uniquely to a set of rules for manipulating degrees of belief that are equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability. This provided the \ufb01rst rigorous proof that probability theory could be regarded as an extension of Boolean logic to situations involving uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003). Numerous other authors have proposed different sets of properties or axioms that such measures of uncertainty should satisfy (Ramsey, 1931; Good, 1950; Savage, 1961; deFinetti, 1970; Lindley, 1982). In each case, the resulting numerical quantities behave pre- cisely according to the rules of probability. It is therefore natural to refer to these quantities as (Bayesian) probabilities. In the \ufb01eld of pattern recognition, too, it is helpful to have a more general no- Thomas Bayes 1701\u20131761 Thomas Bayes was born in Tun- bridge Wells and was a clergyman as well as an amateur scientist and a mathematician. He studied logic and theology at Edinburgh Univer- sity and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1742. During the 18th century, is- sues regarding probability arose in connection with gambling and with the new concept of insurance. One particularly important problem concerned so-called in- verse probability. A solution was proposed by Thomas Bayes in his paper \u2018Essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances\u2019, which was published in 1764, some three years after his death, in the Philo- sophical Transactions of the Royal Society. In fact, Bayes only formulated his theory for the case of a uni- form prior, and it was Pierre-Simon Laplace who inde- pendently rediscovered the theory in general form and who demonstrated its broad applicability.",

It seems reasonable to apply the frequentist notion of probability to the random values of the observed variables tn. However, we would like to address and quantify the uncertainty that surrounds the appropriate choice for the model param- eters w. We shall see that, from a Bayesian perspective, we can use the machinery of probability theory to describe the uncertainty in model parameters such as w, or indeed in the choice of model itself. Bayes\u2019 theorem now acquires a new signi\ufb01cance. Recall that in the boxes of fruit example, the observation of the identity of the fruit provided relevant information that altered the probability that the chosen box was the red one. In that example, Bayes\u2019 theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability by incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data. As we shall see in detail later, we can adopt a similar approach when making inferences about quantities such as the parameters w in the polynomial curve \ufb01tting example. We capture our assumptions about w, before observing the data, in the form of a prior probability distribution p(w). The effect of the observed data D = {t1, . . . , tN} is expressed through the conditional probability p(D|w), and we shall see later, in Section 1.2.5, how this can be represented explicitly. Bayes\u2019 theorem, which takes the form p(w|D) = p(D|w)p(w) p(D) (1.43) then allows us to evaluate the uncertainty in w after we have observed D in the form of the posterior probability p(w|D). The quantity p(D|w) on the right-hand side of Bayes\u2019 theorem is evaluated for the observed data set D and can be viewed as a function of the parameter vector w, in which case it is called the likelihood function. It expresses how probable the observed data set is for different settings of the parameter vector w. Note that the likelihood is not a probability distribution over w, and its integral with respect to w does not (necessarily) equal one. Given this de\ufb01nition of likelihood, we can state Bayes\u2019 theorem in words posterior \u221dlikelihood \u00d7 prior (1.44) where all of these quantities are viewed as functions of w. The denominator in (1.43) is the normalization constant, which ensures that the posterior distribution on the left-hand side is a valid probability density and integrates to one. Indeed, integrating both sides of (1.43) with respect to w, we can express the denominator in Bayes\u2019 theorem in terms of the prior distribution and the likelihood function p(D) = \u0006 p(D|w)p(w) dw. (1.45) In both the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms, the likelihood function p(D|w) plays a central role. However, the manner in which it is used is fundamentally dif- ferent in the two approaches. In a frequentist setting, w is considered to be a \ufb01xed parameter, whose value is determined by some form of \u2018estimator\u2019, and error bars",

    "text": "1.2. Probability Theory 23 on this estimate are obtained by considering the distribution of possible data sets D. By contrast, from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely the one that is actually observed), and the uncertainty in the parameters is expressed through a probability distribution over w. A widely used frequentist estimator is maximum likelihood, in which w is set to the value that maximizes the likelihood function p(D|w). This corresponds to choosing the value of w for which the probability of the observed data set is maxi- mized. In the machine learning literature, the negative log of the likelihood function is called an error function. Because the negative logarithm is a monotonically de- creasing function, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the error. One approach to determining frequentist error bars is the bootstrap (Efron, 1979; Hastie et al., 2001), in which multiple data sets are created as follows. Suppose our original data set consists of N data points X = {x1, . . . , xN}. We can create a new data set XB by drawing N points at random from X, with replacement, so that some points in X may be replicated in XB, whereas other points in X may be absent from XB. This process can be repeated L times to generate L data sets each of size N and each obtained by sampling from the original data set X. The statistical accuracy of parameter estimates can then be evaluated by looking at the variability of predictions between the different bootstrap data sets. One advantage of the Bayesian viewpoint is that the inclusion of prior knowl- edge arises naturally. Suppose, for instance, that a fair-looking coin is tossed three times and lands heads each time. A classical maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of landing heads would give 1, implying that all future tosses will land Section 2.1 heads! By contrast, a Bayesian approach with any reasonable prior will lead to a much less extreme conclusion. There has been much controversy and debate associated with the relative mer- its of the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, which have not been helped by the fact that there is no unique frequentist, or even Bayesian, viewpoint. For instance, one common criticism of the Bayesian approach is that the prior distribution is of- ten selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rather than as a re\ufb02ection of any prior beliefs. Even the subjective nature of the conclusions through their de- pendence on the choice of prior is seen by some as a source of dif\ufb01culty. Reducing the dependence on the prior is one motivation for so-called noninformative priors. Section 2.4.3 However, these lead to dif\ufb01culties when comparing different models, and indeed Bayesian methods based on poor choices of prior can give poor results with high con\ufb01dence. Frequentist evaluation methods offer some protection from such prob- lems, and techniques such as cross-validation remain useful in areas such as model Section 1.3 comparison. This book places a strong emphasis on the Bayesian viewpoint, re\ufb02ecting the huge growth in the practical importance of Bayesian methods in the past few years, while also discussing useful frequentist concepts as required. Although the Bayesian framework has its origins in the 18th century, the prac- tical application of Bayesian methods was for a long time severely limited by the dif\ufb01culties in carrying through the full Bayesian procedure, particularly the need to marginalize (sum or integrate) over the whole of parameter space, which, as we shall",

The development of sampling methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (discussed in Chapter 11) along with dramatic improvements in the speed and memory capacity of computers, opened the door to the practical use of Bayesian techniques in an im- pressive range of problem domains. Monte Carlo methods are very \ufb02exible and can be applied to a wide range of models. However, they are computationally intensive and have mainly been used for small-scale problems. More recently, highly ef\ufb01cient deterministic approximation schemes such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation (discussed in Chapter 10) have been developed. These offer a complementary alternative to sampling methods and have allowed Bayesian techniques to be used in large-scale applications (Blei et al., 2003). 1.2.4 The Gaussian distribution We shall devote the whole of Chapter 2 to a study of various probability dis- tributions and their key properties. It is convenient, however, to introduce here one of the most important probability distributions for continuous variables, called the normal or Gaussian distribution. We shall make extensive use of this distribution in the remainder of this chapter and indeed throughout much of the book. For the case of a single real-valued variable x, the Gaussian distribution is de- \ufb01ned by N x|\u00b5, \u03c32 = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c32)1/2 exp \u22121 2\u03c32 (x \u2212\u00b5)2 (1.46) which is governed by two parameters: \u00b5, called the mean, and \u03c32, called the vari- ance. The square root of the variance, given by \u03c3, is called the standard deviation, and the reciprocal of the variance, written as \u03b2 = 1/\u03c32, is called the precision. We shall see the motivation for these terms shortly. Figure 1.13 shows a plot of the Gaussian distribution. From the form of (1.46) we see that the Gaussian distribution satis\ufb01es N(x|\u00b5, \u03c32) > 0. (1.47) Also it is straightforward to show that the Gaussian is normalized, so that Exercise 1.7 Pierre-Simon Laplace 1749\u20131827 It is said that Laplace was seri- ously lacking in modesty and at one point declared himself to be the best mathematician in France at the time, a claim that was arguably true. As well as being proli\ufb01c in mathe- matics, he also made numerous contributions to as- tronomy, including the nebular hypothesis by which the earth is thought to have formed from the condensa- tion and cooling of a large rotating disk of gas and dust. In 1812 he published the \ufb01rst edition of Th\u00b4eorie Analytique des Probabilit\u00b4es, in which Laplace states that \u201cprobability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation\u201d. This work included a discus- sion of the inverse probability calculation (later termed Bayes\u2019 theorem by Poincar\u00b4e), which he used to solve problems in life expectancy, jurisprudence, planetary masses, triangulation, and error estimation.",

Note that we are using the type- face x to distinguish this from a single observation of the vector-valued variable (x1, . . . , xD)T, which we denote by x. We shall suppose that the observations are drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution whose mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32 are unknown, and we would like to determine these parameters from the data set. Data points that are drawn independently from the same distribution are said to be independent and identically distributed, which is often abbreviated to i.i.d. We have seen that the joint probability of two independent events is given by the product of the marginal probabilities for each event separately. Because our data set x is i.i.d., we can therefore write the probability of the data set, given \u00b5 and \u03c32, in the form p(x|\u00b5, \u03c32) = N \u000e n=1 N xn|\u00b5, \u03c32 . (1.53) When viewed as a function of \u00b5 and \u03c32, this is the likelihood function for the Gaus- sian and is interpreted diagrammatically in Figure 1.14. One common criterion for determining the parameters in a probability distribu- tion using an observed data set is to \ufb01nd the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function. This might seem like a strange criterion because, from our fore- going discussion of probability theory, it would seem more natural to maximize the probability of the parameters given the data, not the probability of the data given the parameters. In fact, these two criteria are related, as we shall discuss in the context of curve \ufb01tting. Section 1.2.5 For the moment, however, we shall determine values for the unknown parame- ters \u00b5 and \u03c32 in the Gaussian by maximizing the likelihood function (1.53). In prac- tice, it is more convenient to maximize the log of the likelihood function. Because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function of its argument, maximization of the log of a function is equivalent to maximization of the function itself. Taking the log not only simpli\ufb01es the subsequent mathematical analysis, but it also helps numerically because the product of a large number of small probabilities can easily under\ufb02ow the numerical precision of the computer, and this is resolved by computing instead the sum of the log probabilities.

(1.54) Maximizing (1.54) with respect to \u00b5, we obtain the maximum likelihood solution given by Exercise 1.11 \u00b5ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 xn (1.55) which is the sample mean, i.e., the mean of the observed values {xn}. Similarly, maximizing (1.54) with respect to \u03c32, we obtain the maximum likelihood solution for the variance in the form \u03c32 ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5ML)2 (1.56) which is the sample variance measured with respect to the sample mean \u00b5ML. Note that we are performing a joint maximization of (1.54) with respect to \u00b5 and \u03c32, but in the case of the Gaussian distribution the solution for \u00b5 decouples from that for \u03c32 so that we can \ufb01rst evaluate (1.55) and then subsequently use this result to evaluate (1.56). Later in this chapter, and also in subsequent chapters, we shall highlight the sig- ni\ufb01cant limitations of the maximum likelihood approach. Here we give an indication of the problem in the context of our solutions for the maximum likelihood param- eter settings for the univariate Gaussian distribution. In particular, we shall show that the maximum likelihood approach systematically underestimates the variance of the distribution. This is an example of a phenomenon called bias and is related to the problem of over-\ufb01tting encountered in the context of polynomial curve \ufb01tting. Section 1.1 We \ufb01rst note that the maximum likelihood solutions \u00b5ML and \u03c32 ML are functions of the data set values x1, . . . , xN. Consider the expectations of these quantities with respect to the data set values, which themselves come from a Gaussian distribution with parameters \u00b5 and \u03c32. It is straightforward to show that Exercise 1.12 E[\u00b5ML] = \u00b5 (1.57) E[\u03c32 ML] = \u000fN \u22121 N \u0010 \u03c32 (1.58) so that on average the maximum likelihood estimate will obtain the correct mean but will underestimate the true variance by a factor (N \u22121)/N. The intuition behind this result is given by Figure 1.15. From (1.58) it follows that the following estimate for the variance parameter is unbiased \u0004\u03c32 = N N \u22121\u03c32 ML = 1 N \u22121 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5ML)2. (1.59)",

The green curve shows the true Gaussian distribution from which data is generated, and the three red curves show the Gaussian distributions obtained by \ufb01tting to three data sets, each consist- ing of two data points shown in blue, us- ing the maximum likelihood results (1.55) and (1.56). Averaged across the three data sets, the mean is correct, but the variance is systematically under-estimated because it is measured relative to the sample mean and not relative to the true mean. (a) (b) (c) In Section 10.1.3, we shall see how this result arises automatically when we adopt a Bayesian approach. Note that the bias of the maximum likelihood solution becomes less signi\ufb01cant as the number N of data points increases, and in the limit N \u2192\u221ethe maximum likelihood solution for the variance equals the true variance of the distribution that generated the data. In practice, for anything other than small N, this bias will not prove to be a serious problem. However, throughout this book we shall be interested in more complex models with many parameters, for which the bias problems asso- ciated with maximum likelihood will be much more severe. In fact, as we shall see, the issue of bias in maximum likelihood lies at the root of the over-\ufb01tting problem that we encountered earlier in the context of polynomial curve \ufb01tting. 1.2.5 Curve \ufb01tting re-visited We have seen how the problem of polynomial curve \ufb01tting can be expressed in terms of error minimization. Here we return to the curve \ufb01tting example and view it Section 1.1 from a probabilistic perspective, thereby gaining some insights into error functions and regularization, as well as taking us towards a full Bayesian treatment. The goal in the curve \ufb01tting problem is to be able to make predictions for the target variable t given some new value of the input variable x on the basis of a set of training data comprising N input values x = (x1, . . . , xN)T and their corresponding target values t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. We can express our uncertainty over the value of the target variable using a probability distribution. For this purpose, we shall assume that, given the value of x, the corresponding value of t has a Gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the value y(x, w) of the polynomial curve given by (1.1). Thus we have p(t|x, w, \u03b2) = N t|y(x, w), \u03b2\u22121 (1.60) where, for consistency with the notation in later chapters, we have de\ufb01ned a preci- sion parameter \u03b2 corresponding to the inverse variance of the distribution. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.16.",

If the data are assumed to be drawn independently from the distribution (1.60), then the likelihood function is given by p(t|x, w, \u03b2) = N \u000e n=1 N tn|y(xn, w), \u03b2\u22121 . (1.61) As we did in the case of the simple Gaussian distribution earlier, it is convenient to maximize the logarithm of the likelihood function. Substituting for the form of the Gaussian distribution, given by (1.46), we obtain the log likelihood function in the form ln p(t|x, w, \u03b2) = \u2212\u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, w) \u2212tn}2 + N 2 ln \u03b2 \u2212N 2 ln(2\u03c0). (1.62) Consider \ufb01rst the determination of the maximum likelihood solution for the polyno- mial coef\ufb01cients, which will be denoted by wML. These are determined by maxi- mizing (1.62) with respect to w. For this purpose, we can omit the last two terms on the right-hand side of (1.62) because they do not depend on w. Also, we note that scaling the log likelihood by a positive constant coef\ufb01cient does not alter the location of the maximum with respect to w, and so we can replace the coef\ufb01cient \u03b2/2 with 1/2. Finally, instead of maximizing the log likelihood, we can equivalently minimize the negative log likelihood. We therefore see that maximizing likelihood is equivalent, so far as determining w is concerned, to minimizing the sum-of-squares error function de\ufb01ned by (1.2). Thus the sum-of-squares error function has arisen as a consequence of maximizing likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian noise distribution. We can also use maximum likelihood to determine the precision parameter \u03b2 of the Gaussian conditional distribution. Maximizing (1.62) with respect to \u03b2 gives 1 \u03b2ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, wML) \u2212tn}2 . (1.63)",

INTRODUCTION Again we can \ufb01rst determine the parameter vector wML governing the mean and sub- sequently use this to \ufb01nd the precision \u03b2ML as was the case for the simple Gaussian distribution. Section 1.2.4 Having determined the parameters w and \u03b2, we can now make predictions for new values of x. Because we now have a probabilistic model, these are expressed in terms of the predictive distribution that gives the probability distribution over t, rather than simply a point estimate, and is obtained by substituting the maximum likelihood parameters into (1.60) to give p(t|x, wML, \u03b2ML) = N t|y(x, wML), \u03b2\u22121 ML . (1.64) Now let us take a step towards a more Bayesian approach and introduce a prior distribution over the polynomial coef\ufb01cients w. For simplicity, let us consider a Gaussian distribution of the form p(w|\u03b1) = N(w|0, \u03b1\u22121I) = \u0011 \u03b1 2\u03c0 \u0012(M+1)/2 exp \u0013 \u2212\u03b1 2 wTw \u0014 (1.65) where \u03b1 is the precision of the distribution, and M +1 is the total number of elements in the vector w for an M th order polynomial. Variables such as \u03b1, which control the distribution of model parameters, are called hyperparameters. Using Bayes\u2019 theorem, the posterior distribution for w is proportional to the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function p(w|x, t, \u03b1, \u03b2) \u221dp(t|x, w, \u03b2)p(w|\u03b1). (1.66) We can now determine w by \ufb01nding the most probable value of w given the data, in other words by maximizing the posterior distribution. This technique is called maximum posterior, or simply MAP. Taking the negative logarithm of (1.66) and combining with (1.62) and (1.65), we \ufb01nd that the maximum of the posterior is given by the minimum of \u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, w) \u2212tn}2 + \u03b1 2 wTw. (1.67) Thus we see that maximizing the posterior distribution is equivalent to minimizing the regularized sum-of-squares error function encountered earlier in the form (1.4), with a regularization parameter given by \u03bb = \u03b1/\u03b2. 1.2.6 Bayesian curve \ufb01tting Although we have included a prior distribution p(w|\u03b1), we are so far still mak- ing a point estimate of w and so this does not yet amount to a Bayesian treatment. In a fully Bayesian approach, we should consistently apply the sum and product rules of probability, which requires, as we shall see shortly, that we integrate over all val- ues of w. Such marginalizations lie at the heart of Bayesian methods for pattern recognition.",

We therefore wish to evaluate the predictive distribution p(t|x, x, t). Here we shall assume that the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are \ufb01xed and known in advance (in later chapters we shall discuss how such parameters can be inferred from data in a Bayesian setting). A Bayesian treatment simply corresponds to a consistent application of the sum and product rules of probability, which allow the predictive distribution to be written in the form p(t|x, x, t) = \u0006 p(t|x, w)p(w|x, t) dw. (1.68) Here p(t|x, w) is given by (1.60), and we have omitted the dependence on \u03b1 and \u03b2 to simplify the notation. Here p(w|x, t) is the posterior distribution over param- eters, and can be found by normalizing the right-hand side of (1.66). We shall see in Section 3.3 that, for problems such as the curve-\ufb01tting example, this posterior distribution is a Gaussian and can be evaluated analytically. Similarly, the integra- tion in (1.68) can also be performed analytically with the result that the predictive distribution is given by a Gaussian of the form p(t|x, x, t) = N t|m(x), s2(x) (1.69) where the mean and variance are given by m(x) = \u03b2\u03c6(x)TS N \u0002 n=1 \u03c6(xn)tn (1.70) s2(x) = \u03b2\u22121 + \u03c6(x)TS\u03c6(x).

We see that the variance, as well as the mean, of the predictive distribution in (1.69) is dependent on x. The \ufb01rst term in (1.71) represents the uncertainty in the predicted value of t due to the noise on the target variables and was expressed already in the maximum likelihood predictive distribution (1.64) through \u03b2\u22121 ML. However, the second term arises from the uncertainty in the parameters w and is a consequence of the Bayesian treatment. The predictive distribution for the synthetic sinusoidal regression problem is illustrated in Figure 1.17.",

Model Selection In our example of polynomial curve \ufb01tting using least squares, we saw that there was an optimal order of polynomial that gave the best generalization. The order of the polynomial controls the number of free parameters in the model and thereby governs the model complexity. With regularized least squares, the regularization coef\ufb01cient \u03bb also controls the effective complexity of the model, whereas for more complex models, such as mixture distributions or neural networks there may be multiple pa- rameters governing complexity. In a practical application, we need to determine the values of such parameters, and the principal objective in doing so is usually to achieve the best predictive performance on new data. Furthermore, as well as \ufb01nd- ing the appropriate values for complexity parameters within a given model, we may wish to consider a range of different types of model in order to \ufb01nd the best one for our particular application. We have already seen that, in the maximum likelihood approach, the perfor- mance on the training set is not a good indicator of predictive performance on un- seen data due to the problem of over-\ufb01tting. If data is plentiful, then one approach is simply to use some of the available data to train a range of models, or a given model with a range of values for its complexity parameters, and then to compare them on independent data, sometimes called a validation set, and select the one having the best predictive performance. If the model design is iterated many times using a lim- ited size data set, then some over-\ufb01tting to the validation data can occur and so it may be necessary to keep aside a third test set on which the performance of the selected model is \ufb01nally evaluated. In many applications, however, the supply of data for training and testing will be limited, and in order to build good models, we wish to use as much of the available data as possible for training. However, if the validation set is small, it will give a relatively noisy estimate of predictive performance. One solution to this dilemma is to use cross-validation, which is illustrated in Figure 1.18. This allows a proportion (S \u22121)/S of the available data to be used for training while making use of all of the",

The Curse of Dimensionality 33 Figure 1.18 The technique of S-fold cross-validation, illus- trated here for the case of S = 4, involves tak- ing the available data and partitioning it into S groups (in the simplest case these are of equal size). Then S \u22121 of the groups are used to train a set of models that are then evaluated on the re- maining group. This procedure is then repeated for all S possible choices for the held-out group, indicated here by the red blocks, and the perfor- mance scores from the S runs are then averaged. run 1 run 2 run 3 run 4 data to assess performance. When data is particularly scarce, it may be appropriate to consider the case S = N, where N is the total number of data points, which gives the leave-one-out technique. One major drawback of cross-validation is that the number of training runs that must be performed is increased by a factor of S, and this can prove problematic for models in which the training is itself computationally expensive. A further problem with techniques such as cross-validation that use separate data to assess performance is that we might have multiple complexity parameters for a single model (for in- stance, there might be several regularization parameters). Exploring combinations of settings for such parameters could, in the worst case, require a number of training runs that is exponential in the number of parameters. Clearly, we need a better ap- proach. Ideally, this should rely only on the training data and should allow multiple hyperparameters and model types to be compared in a single training run. We there- fore need to \ufb01nd a measure of performance which depends only on the training data and which does not suffer from bias due to over-\ufb01tting. Historically various \u2018information criteria\u2019 have been proposed that attempt to correct for the bias of maximum likelihood by the addition of a penalty term to compensate for the over-\ufb01tting of more complex models. For example, the Akaike information criterion, or AIC (Akaike, 1974), chooses the model for which the quan- tity ln p(D|wML) \u2212M (1.73) is largest. Here p(D|wML) is the best-\ufb01t log likelihood, and M is the number of adjustable parameters in the model. A variant of this quantity, called the Bayesian information criterion, or BIC, will be discussed in Section 4.4.1. Such criteria do not take account of the uncertainty in the model parameters, however, and in practice they tend to favour overly simple models. We therefore turn in Section 3.4 to a fully Bayesian approach where we shall see how complexity penalties arise in a natural and principled way. 1.4.

As we now discuss, this poses some serious challenges and is an important factor in\ufb02uencing the design of pattern recognition techniques. In order to illustrate the problem we consider a synthetically generated data set representing measurements taken from a pipeline containing a mixture of oil, wa- ter, and gas (Bishop and James, 1993). These three materials can be present in one of three different geometrical con\ufb01gurations known as \u2018homogenous\u2019, \u2018annular\u2019, and \u2018laminar\u2019, and the fractions of the three materials can also vary. Each data point com- prises a 12-dimensional input vector consisting of measurements taken with gamma ray densitometers that measure the attenuation of gamma rays passing along nar- row beams through the pipe. This data set is described in detail in Appendix A. Figure 1.19 shows 100 points from this data set on a plot showing two of the mea- surements x6 and x7 (the remaining ten input values are ignored for the purposes of this illustration). Each data point is labelled according to which of the three geomet- rical classes it belongs to, and our goal is to use this data as a training set in order to be able to classify a new observation (x6, x7), such as the one denoted by the cross in Figure 1.19. We observe that the cross is surrounded by numerous red points, and so we might suppose that it belongs to the red class. However, there are also plenty of green points nearby, so we might think that it could instead belong to the green class. It seems unlikely that it belongs to the blue class. The intuition here is that the identity of the cross should be determined more strongly by nearby points from the training set and less strongly by more distant points. In fact, this intuition turns out to be reasonable and will be discussed more fully in later chapters. How can we turn this intuition into a learning algorithm? One very simple ap- proach would be to divide the input space into regular cells, as indicated in Fig- ure 1.20.

There are numerous problems with this naive approach, but one of the most se- vere becomes apparent when we consider its extension to problems having larger numbers of input variables, corresponding to input spaces of higher dimensionality. The origin of the problem is illustrated in Figure 1.21, which shows that, if we divide a region of a space into regular cells, then the number of such cells grows exponen- tially with the dimensionality of the space. The problem with an exponentially large number of cells is that we would need an exponentially large quantity of training data in order to ensure that the cells are not empty.

If we have D input variables, then a general polynomial with coef\ufb01cients up to order 3 would take the form y(x, w) = w0 + D \u0002 i=1 wixi + D \u0002 i=1 D \u0002 j=1 wijxixj + D \u0002 i=1 D \u0002 j=1 D \u0002 k=1 wijkxixjxk. (1.74) As D increases, so the number of independent coef\ufb01cients (not all of the coef\ufb01cients are independent due to interchange symmetries amongst the x variables) grows pro- portionally to D3. In practice, to capture complex dependencies in the data, we may need to use a higher-order polynomial. For a polynomial of order M, the growth in the number of coef\ufb01cients is like DM. Although this is now a power law growth, Exercise 1.16 rather than an exponential growth, it still points to the method becoming rapidly unwieldy and of limited practical utility. Our geometrical intuitions, formed through a life spent in a space of three di- mensions, can fail badly when we consider spaces of higher dimensionality. As a simple example, consider a sphere of radius r = 1 in a space of D dimensions, and ask what is the fraction of the volume of the sphere that lies between radius r = 1\u2212\u03f5 and r = 1. We can evaluate this fraction by noting that the volume of a sphere of radius r in D dimensions must scale as rD, and so we write VD(r) = KDrD (1.75) where the constant KD depends only on D. Thus the required fraction is given by Exercise 1.18 VD(1) \u2212VD(1 \u2212\u03f5) VD(1) = 1 \u2212(1 \u2212\u03f5)D (1.76) which is plotted as a function of \u03f5 for various values of D in Figure 1.22. We see that, for large D, this fraction tends to 1 even for small values of \u03f5. Thus, in spaces of high dimensionality, most of the volume of a sphere is concentrated in a thin shell near the surface! As a further example, of direct relevance to pattern recognition, consider the behaviour of a Gaussian distribution in a high-dimensional space. If we transform from Cartesian to polar coordinates, and then integrate out the directional variables, we obtain an expression for the density p(r) as a function of radius r from the origin. Exercise 1.20 Thus p(r)\u03b4r is the probability mass inside a thin shell of thickness \u03b4r located at radius r. This distribution is plotted, for various values of D, in Figure 1.23, and we see that for large D the probability mass of the Gaussian is concentrated in a thin shell. The severe dif\ufb01culty that can arise in spaces of many dimensions is sometimes called the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961). In this book, we shall make ex- tensive use of illustrative examples involving input spaces of one or two dimensions, because this makes it particularly easy to illustrate the techniques graphically. The reader should be warned, however, that not all intuitions developed in spaces of low dimensionality will generalize to spaces of many dimensions.",

The reasons for this are twofold. First, real data will often be con\ufb01ned to a region of the space having lower effective dimension- ality, and in particular the directions over which important variations in the target variables occur may be so con\ufb01ned. Second, real data will typically exhibit some smoothness properties (at least locally) so that for the most part small changes in the input variables will produce small changes in the target variables, and so we can ex- ploit local interpolation-like techniques to allow us to make predictions of the target variables for new values of the input variables. Successful pattern recognition tech- niques exploit one or both of these properties.

Because the objects can occur at different positions within the image and in different orientations, there are three degrees of freedom of variability between images, and a set of images will live on a three dimensional manifold embedded within the high-dimensional space. Due to the complex relationships between the object position or orientation and the pixel intensities, this manifold will be highly nonlinear. If the goal is to learn a model that can take an input image and output the orientation of the object irrespective of its position, then there is only one degree of freedom of variability within the manifold that is signi\ufb01cant. 1.5. Decision Theory We have seen in Section 1.2 how probability theory provides us with a consistent mathematical framework for quantifying and manipulating uncertainty. Here we turn to a discussion of decision theory that, when combined with probability theory, allows us to make optimal decisions in situations involving uncertainty such as those encountered in pattern recognition. Suppose we have an input vector x together with a corresponding vector t of target variables, and our goal is to predict t given a new value for x. For regression problems, t will comprise continuous variables, whereas for classi\ufb01cation problems t will represent class labels. The joint probability distribution p(x, t) provides a complete summary of the uncertainty associated with these variables. Determination of p(x, t) from a set of training data is an example of inference and is typically a very dif\ufb01cult problem whose solution forms the subject of much of this book. In a practical application, however, we must often make a speci\ufb01c prediction for the value of t, or more generally take a speci\ufb01c action based on our understanding of the values t is likely to take, and this aspect is the subject of decision theory. Consider, for example, a medical diagnosis problem in which we have taken an X-ray image of a patient, and we wish to determine whether the patient has cancer or not. In this case, the input vector x is the set of pixel intensities in the image, and output variable t will represent the presence of cancer, which we denote by the class C1, or the absence of cancer, which we denote by the class C2. We might, for instance, choose t to be a binary variable such that t = 0 corresponds to class C1 and t = 1 corresponds to class C2. We shall see later that this choice of label values is particularly convenient for probabilistic models. The general inference problem then involves determining the joint distribution p(x, Ck), or equivalently p(x, t), which gives us the most complete probabilistic description of the situation. Although this can be a very useful and informative quantity, in the end we must decide either to give treatment to the patient or not, and we would like this choice to be optimal in some appropriate sense (Duda and Hart, 1973). This is the decision step, and it is the subject of decision theory to tell us how to make optimal decisions given the appropriate probabilities. We shall see that the decision stage is generally very simple, even trivial, once we have solved the inference problem. Here we give an introduction to the key ideas of decision theory as required for",

Before giving a more detailed analysis, let us \ufb01rst consider informally how we might expect probabilities to play a role in making decisions. When we obtain the X-ray image x for a new patient, our goal is to decide which of the two classes to assign to the image. We are interested in the probabilities of the two classes given the image, which are given by p(Ck|x). Using Bayes\u2019 theorem, these probabilities can be expressed in the form p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) . (1.77) Note that any of the quantities appearing in Bayes\u2019 theorem can be obtained from the joint distribution p(x, Ck) by either marginalizing or conditioning with respect to the appropriate variables. We can now interpret p(Ck) as the prior probability for the class Ck, and p(Ck|x) as the corresponding posterior probability. Thus p(C1) repre- sents the probability that a person has cancer, before we take the X-ray measurement. Similarly, p(C1|x) is the corresponding probability, revised using Bayes\u2019 theorem in light of the information contained in the X-ray. If our aim is to minimize the chance of assigning x to the wrong class, then intuitively we would choose the class having the higher posterior probability. We now show that this intuition is correct, and we also discuss more general criteria for making decisions. 1.5.1 Minimizing the misclassi\ufb01cation rate Suppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassi\ufb01cations as possible. We need a rule that assigns each value of x to one of the available classes. Such a rule will divide the input space into regions Rk called decision regions, one for each class, such that all points in Rk are assigned to class Ck. The boundaries between decision regions are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. Note that each decision region need not be contiguous but could comprise some number of disjoint regions. We shall encounter examples of decision boundaries and decision regions in later chapters. In order to \ufb01nd the optimal decision rule, consider \ufb01rst of all the case of two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance. A mistake occurs when an input vector belonging to class C1 is assigned to class C2 or vice versa. The probability of this occurring is given by p(mistake) = p(x \u2208R1, C2) + p(x \u2208R2, C1) = \u0006 R1 p(x, C2) dx + \u0006 R2 p(x, C1) dx. (1.78) We are free to choose the decision rule that assigns each point x to one of the two classes. Clearly to minimize p(mistake) we should arrange that each x is assigned to whichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in (1.78). Thus, if p(x, C1) > p(x, C2) for a given value of x, then we should assign that x to class C1. From the product rule of probability we have p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x). Because the factor p(x) is common to both terms, we can restate this result as saying that the minimum",

Values of x \u2a7ebx are classi\ufb01ed as class C2 and hence belong to decision region R2, whereas points x < bx are classi\ufb01ed as C1 and belong to R1. Errors arise from the blue, green, and red regions, so that for x < bx the errors are due to points from class C2 being misclassi\ufb01ed as C1 (represented by the sum of the red and green regions), and conversely for points in the region x \u2a7ebx the errors are due to points from class C1 being misclassi\ufb01ed as C2 (represented by the blue region). As we vary the location bx of the decision boundary, the combined areas of the blue and green regions remains constant, whereas the size of the red region varies. The optimal choice for bx is where the curves for p(x, C1) and p(x, C2) cross, corresponding to bx = x0, because in this case the red region disappears. This is equivalent to the minimum misclassi\ufb01cation rate decision rule, which assigns each value of x to the class having the higher posterior probability p(Ck|x). probability of making a mistake is obtained if each value of x is assigned to the class for which the posterior probability p(Ck|x) is largest. This result is illustrated for two classes, and a single input variable x, in Figure 1.24. For the more general case of K classes, it is slightly easier to maximize the probability of being correct, which is given by p(correct) = K \u0002 k=1 p(x \u2208Rk, Ck) = K \u0002 k=1 \u0006 Rk p(x, Ck) dx (1.79) which is maximized when the regions Rk are chosen such that each x is assigned to the class for which p(x, Ck) is largest. Again, using the product rule p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x), and noting that the factor of p(x) is common to all terms, we see that each x should be assigned to the class having the largest posterior probability p(Ck|x).",

Let us consider again the medical diagnosis problem. We note that, if a patient who does not have cancer is incorrectly diagnosed as having cancer, the consequences may be some patient distress plus the need for further investigations. Conversely, if a patient with cancer is diagnosed as healthy, the result may be premature death due to lack of treatment. Thus the consequences of these two types of mistake can be dramatically different. It would clearly be better to make fewer mistakes of the second kind, even if this was at the expense of making more mistakes of the \ufb01rst kind. We can formalize such issues through the introduction of a loss function, also called a cost function, which is a single, overall measure of loss incurred in taking any of the available decisions or actions. Our goal is then to minimize the total loss incurred. Note that some authors consider instead a utility function, whose value they aim to maximize. These are equivalent concepts if we take the utility to be simply the negative of the loss, and throughout this text we shall use the loss function convention. Suppose that, for a new value of x, the true class is Ck and that we assign x to class Cj (where j may or may not be equal to k). In so doing, we incur some level of loss that we denote by Lkj, which we can view as the k, j element of a loss matrix. For instance, in our cancer example, we might have a loss matrix of the form shown in Figure 1.25. This particular loss matrix says that there is no loss incurred if the correct decision is made, there is a loss of 1 if a healthy patient is diagnosed as having cancer, whereas there is a loss of 1000 if a patient having cancer is diagnosed as healthy. The optimal solution is the one which minimizes the loss function. However, the loss function depends on the true class, which is unknown. For a given input vector x, our uncertainty in the true class is expressed through the joint probability distribution p(x, Ck) and so we seek instead to minimize the average loss, where the average is computed with respect to this distribution, which is given by E[L] = \u0002 k \u0002 j \u0006 Rj Lkjp(x, Ck) dx. (1.80) Each x can be assigned independently to one of the decision regions Rj. Our goal is to choose the regions Rj in order to minimize the expected loss (1.80), which implies that for each x we should minimize \u0005 k Lkjp(x, Ck). As before, we can use the product rule p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x) to eliminate the common factor of p(x). Thus the decision rule that minimizes the expected loss is the one that assigns each",

This is clearly trivial to do, once we know the posterior class proba- bilities p(Ck|x). 1.5.3 The reject option We have seen that classi\ufb01cation errors arise from the regions of input space where the largest of the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is signi\ufb01cantly less than unity, or equivalently where the joint distributions p(x, Ck) have comparable values. These are the regions where we are relatively uncertain about class membership. In some applications, it will be appropriate to avoid making decisions on the dif\ufb01cult cases in anticipation of a lower error rate on those examples for which a classi\ufb01cation de- cision is made. This is known as the reject option. For example, in our hypothetical medical illustration, it may be appropriate to use an automatic system to classify those X-ray images for which there is little doubt as to the correct class, while leav- ing a human expert to classify the more ambiguous cases. We can achieve this by introducing a threshold \u03b8 and rejecting those inputs x for which the largest of the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is less than or equal to \u03b8. This is illustrated for the case of two classes, and a single continuous input variable x, in Figure 1.26. Note that setting \u03b8 = 1 will ensure that all examples are rejected, whereas if there are K classes then setting \u03b8 < 1/K will ensure that no examples are rejected. Thus the fraction of examples that get rejected is controlled by the value of \u03b8. We can easily extend the reject criterion to minimize the expected loss, when a loss matrix is given, taking account of the loss incurred when a reject decision is made.

An alternative possibility would be to solve both problems together and simply learn a function that maps inputs x directly into decisions. Such a function is called a discriminant function. In fact, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving decision problems, all of which have been used in practical applications. These are given, in decreasing order of complexity, by: (a) First solve the inference problem of determining the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck) for each class Ck individually. Also separately infer the prior class probabilities p(Ck). Then use Bayes\u2019 theorem in the form p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) (1.82) to \ufb01nd the posterior class probabilities p(Ck|x). As usual, the denominator in Bayes\u2019 theorem can be found in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator, because p(x) = \u0002 k p(x|Ck)p(Ck). (1.83) Equivalently, we can model the joint distribution p(x, Ck) directly and then normalize to obtain the posterior probabilities. Having found the posterior probabilities, we use decision theory to determine class membership for each new input x. Approaches that explicitly or implicitly model the distribution of inputs as well as outputs are known as generative models, because by sampling from them it is possible to generate synthetic data points in the input space. (b) First solve the inference problem of determining the posterior class probabilities p(Ck|x), and then subsequently use decision theory to assign each new x to one of the classes. Approaches that model the posterior probabilities directly are called discriminative models. (c) Find a function f(x), called a discriminant function, which maps each input x directly onto a class label. For instance, in the case of two-class problems, f(\u00b7) might be binary valued and such that f = 0 represents class C1 and f = 1 represents class C2. In this case, probabilities play no role. Let us consider the relative merits of these three alternatives. Approach (a) is the most demanding because it involves \ufb01nding the joint distribution over both x and Ck. For many applications, x will have high dimensionality, and consequently we may need a large training set in order to be able to determine the class-conditional densities to reasonable accuracy. Note that the class priors p(Ck) can often be esti- mated simply from the fractions of the training set data points in each of the classes. One advantage of approach (a), however, is that it also allows the marginal density of data p(x) to be determined from (1.83). This can be useful for detecting new data points that have low probability under the model and for which the predictions may",

However, if we only wish to make classi\ufb01cation decisions, then it can be waste- ful of computational resources, and excessively demanding of data, to \ufb01nd the joint distribution p(x, Ck) when in fact we only really need the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x), which can be obtained directly through approach (b). Indeed, the class- conditional densities may contain a lot of structure that has little effect on the pos- terior probabilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.27. There has been much interest in exploring the relative merits of generative and discriminative approaches to machine learning, and in \ufb01nding ways to combine them (Jebara, 2004; Lasserre et al., 2006). An even simpler approach is (c) in which we use the training data to \ufb01nd a discriminant function f(x) that maps each x directly onto a class label, thereby combining the inference and decision stages into a single learning problem. In the example of Figure 1.27, this would correspond to \ufb01nding the value of x shown by the vertical green line, because this is the decision boundary giving the minimum probability of misclassi\ufb01cation. With option (c), however, we no longer have access to the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x). There are many powerful reasons for wanting to compute the posterior probabilities, even if we subsequently use them to make decisions. These include: Minimizing risk. Consider a problem in which the elements of the loss matrix are subjected to revision from time to time (such as might occur in a \ufb01nancial",

If we have only a discriminant function, then any change to the loss matrix would require that we return to the training data and solve the classi\ufb01cation problem afresh. Reject option. Posterior probabilities allow us to determine a rejection criterion that will minimize the misclassi\ufb01cation rate, or more generally the expected loss, for a given fraction of rejected data points. Compensating for class priors. Consider our medical X-ray problem again, and suppose that we have collected a large number of X-ray images from the gen- eral population for use as training data in order to build an automated screening system. Because cancer is rare amongst the general population, we might \ufb01nd that, say, only 1 in every 1,000 examples corresponds to the presence of can- cer. If we used such a data set to train an adaptive model, we could run into severe dif\ufb01culties due to the small proportion of the cancer class. For instance, a classi\ufb01er that assigned every point to the normal class would already achieve 99.9% accuracy and it would be dif\ufb01cult to avoid this trivial solution. Also, even a large data set will contain very few examples of X-ray images corre- sponding to cancer, and so the learning algorithm will not be exposed to a broad range of examples of such images and hence is not likely to generalize well. A balanced data set in which we have selected equal numbers of exam- ples from each of the classes would allow us to \ufb01nd a more accurate model. However, we then have to compensate for the effects of our modi\ufb01cations to the training data. Suppose we have used such a modi\ufb01ed data set and found models for the posterior probabilities. From Bayes\u2019 theorem (1.82), we see that the posterior probabilities are proportional to the prior probabilities, which we can interpret as the fractions of points in each class. We can therefore simply take the posterior probabilities obtained from our arti\ufb01cially balanced data set and \ufb01rst divide by the class fractions in that data set and then multiply by the class fractions in the population to which we wish to apply the model. Finally, we need to normalize to ensure that the new posterior probabilities sum to one. Note that this procedure cannot be applied if we have learned a discriminant function directly instead of determining posterior probabilities. Combining models. For complex applications, we may wish to break the problem into a number of smaller subproblems each of which can be tackled by a sep- arate module. For example, in our hypothetical medical diagnosis problem, we may have information available from, say, blood tests as well as X-ray im- ages. Rather than combine all of this heterogeneous information into one huge input space, it may be more effective to build one system to interpret the X- ray images and a different one to interpret the blood data. As long as each of the two models gives posterior probabilities for the classes, we can combine the outputs systematically using the rules of probability. One simple way to do this is to assume that, for each class separately, the distributions of inputs for the X-ray images, denoted by xI, and the blood data, denoted by xB, are",

The posterior probability, given both the X-ray and blood data, is then given by p(Ck|xI, xB) \u221d p(xI, xB|Ck)p(Ck) \u221d p(xI|Ck)p(xB|Ck)p(Ck) \u221d p(Ck|xI)p(Ck|xB) p(Ck) (1.85) Thus we need the class prior probabilities p(Ck), which we can easily estimate from the fractions of data points in each class, and then we need to normalize the resulting posterior probabilities so they sum to one. The particular condi- tional independence assumption (1.84) is an example of the naive Bayes model. Section 8.2.2 Note that the joint marginal distribution p(xI, xB) will typically not factorize under this model. We shall see in later chapters how to construct models for combining data that do not require the conditional independence assumption (1.84). 1.5.5 Loss functions for regression So far, we have discussed decision theory in the context of classi\ufb01cation prob- lems. We now turn to the case of regression problems, such as the curve \ufb01tting example discussed earlier. The decision stage consists of choosing a speci\ufb01c esti- Section 1.1 mate y(x) of the value of t for each input x. Suppose that in doing so, we incur a loss L(t, y(x)). The average, or expected, loss is then given by E[L] = \u0006\u0006 L(t, y(x))p(x, t) dx dt. (1.86) A common choice of loss function in regression problems is the squared loss given by L(t, y(x)) = {y(x) \u2212t}2. In this case, the expected loss can be written E[L] = \u0006\u0006 {y(x) \u2212t}2p(x, t) dx dt. (1.87) Our goal is to choose y(x) so as to minimize E[L]. If we assume a completely \ufb02exible function y(x), we can do this formally using the calculus of variations to Appendix D give \u03b4E[L] \u03b4y(x) = 2 \u0006 {y(x) \u2212t}p(x, t) dt = 0. (1.88) Solving for y(x), and using the sum and product rules of probability, we obtain y(x) = \u0006 tp(x, t) dt p(x) = \u0006 tp(t|x) dt = Et[t|x] (1.89)",

This result is illustrated in Figure 1.28. It can readily be extended to mul- tiple target variables represented by the vector t, in which case the optimal solution is the conditional average y(x) = Et[t|x]. Exercise 1.25 We can also derive this result in a slightly different way, which will also shed light on the nature of the regression problem. Armed with the knowledge that the optimal solution is the conditional expectation, we can expand the square term as follows {y(x) \u2212t}2 = {y(x) \u2212E[t|x] + E[t|x] \u2212t}2 = {y(x) \u2212E[t|x]}2 + 2{y(x) \u2212E[t|x]}{E[t|x] \u2212t} + {E[t|x] \u2212t}2 where, to keep the notation uncluttered, we use E[t|x] to denote Et[t|x]. Substituting into the loss function and performing the integral over t, we see that the cross-term vanishes and we obtain an expression for the loss function in the form E[L] = \u0006 {y(x) \u2212E[t|x]}2 p(x) dx + \u0006 {E[t|x] \u2212t}2p(x) dx.

This is simply the result that we derived previously and that shows that the optimal least squares predictor is given by the conditional mean. The second term is the variance of the distribution of t, averaged over x. It represents the intrinsic variability of the target data and can be regarded as noise. Because it is independent of y(x), it represents the irreducible minimum value of the loss function. As with the classi\ufb01cation problem, we can either determine the appropriate prob- abilities and then use these to make optimal decisions, or we can build models that make decisions directly. Indeed, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving regression problems given, in order of decreasing complexity, by: (a) First solve the inference problem of determining the joint density p(x, t). Then normalize to \ufb01nd the conditional density p(t|x), and \ufb01nally marginalize to \ufb01nd the conditional mean given by (1.89).",

INTRODUCTION (b) First solve the inference problem of determining the conditional density p(t|x), and then subsequently marginalize to \ufb01nd the conditional mean given by (1.89).

The squared loss is not the only possible choice of loss function for regression. Indeed, there are situations in which squared loss can lead to very poor results and where we need to develop more sophisticated approaches. An important example concerns situations in which the conditional distribution p(t|x) is multimodal, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems. Here we consider brie\ufb02y one simple Section 5.6 generalization of the squared loss, called the Minkowski loss, whose expectation is given by E[Lq] = \u0006\u0006 |y(x) \u2212t|qp(x, t) dx dt (1.91) which reduces to the expected squared loss for q = 2. The function |y \u2212t|q is plotted against y \u2212t for various values of q in Figure 1.29. The minimum of E[Lq] is given by the conditional mean for q = 2, the conditional median for q = 1, and the conditional mode for q \u21920. Exercise 1.27 1.6. Information Theory In this chapter, we have discussed a variety of concepts from probability theory and decision theory that will form the foundations for much of the subsequent discussion in this book. We close this chapter by introducing some additional concepts from the \ufb01eld of information theory, which will also prove useful in our development of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. Again, we shall focus only on the key concepts, and we refer the reader elsewhere for more detailed discussions (Viterbi and Omura, 1979; Cover and Thomas, 1991; MacKay, 2003) . We begin by considering a discrete random variable x and we ask how much information is received when we observe a speci\ufb01c value for this variable. The amount of information can be viewed as the \u2018degree of surprise\u2019 on learning the value of x. If we are told that a highly improbable event has just occurred, we will have received more information than if we were told that some very likely event has just occurred, and if we knew that the event was certain to happen we would receive no information. Our measure of information content will therefore depend on the probability distribution p(x), and we therefore look for a quantity h(x) that is a monotonic function of the probability p(x) and that expresses the information content. The form of h(\u00b7) can be found by noting that if we have two events x and y that are unrelated, then the information gain from observing both of them should be the sum of the information gained from each of them separately, so that h(x, y) = h(x) + h(y). Two unrelated events will be statistically independent and so p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). From these two relationships, it is easily shown that h(x) must be given by the logarithm of p(x) and so we have Exercise 1.28",

Note that low probability events x correspond to high information content. The choice of basis for the logarithm is arbitrary, and for the moment we shall adopt the convention prevalent in information theory of using logarithms to the base of 2. In this case, as we shall see shortly, the units of h(x) are bits (\u2018binary digits\u2019). Now suppose that a sender wishes to transmit the value of a random variable to a receiver. The average amount of information that they transmit in the process is obtained by taking the expectation of (1.92) with respect to the distribution p(x) and is given by H[x] = \u2212 \u0002 x p(x) log2 p(x). (1.93) This important quantity is called the entropy of the random variable x. Note that limp\u21920 p ln p = 0 and so we shall take p(x) ln p(x) = 0 whenever we encounter a value for x such that p(x) = 0.

Consider a random variable x having 8 possible states, each of which is equally likely. In order to communicate the value of x to a receiver, we would need to transmit a message of length 3 bits. Notice that the entropy of this variable is given by H[x] = \u22128 \u00d7 1 8 log2 1 8 = 3 bits. Now consider an example (Cover and Thomas, 1991) of a variable having 8 pos- sible states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} for which the respective probabilities are given by ( 1 2, 1 4, 1 8, 1 16, 1 64, 1 64, 1 64, 1 64). The entropy in this case is given by H[x] = \u22121 2 log2 1 2 \u22121 4 log2 1 4 \u22121 8 log2 1 8 \u22121 16 log2 1 16 \u22124 64 log2 1 64 = 2 bits. We see that the nonuniform distribution has a smaller entropy than the uniform one, and we shall gain some insight into this shortly when we discuss the interpretation of entropy in terms of disorder. For the moment, let us consider how we would transmit the identity of the variable\u2019s state to a receiver. We could do this, as before, using a 3-bit number. However, we can take advantage of the nonuniform distribution by using shorter codes for the more probable events, at the expense of longer codes for the less probable events, in the hope of getting a shorter average code length. This can be done by representing the states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} using, for instance, the following set of code strings: 0, 10, 110, 1110, 111100, 111101, 111110, 111111. The average length of the code that has to be transmitted is then average code length = 1 2 \u00d7 1 + 1 4 \u00d7 2 + 1 8 \u00d7 3 + 1 16 \u00d7 4 + 4 \u00d7 1 64 \u00d7 6 = 2 bits which again is the same as the entropy of the random variable. Note that shorter code strings cannot be used because it must be possible to disambiguate a concatenation of such strings into its component parts. For instance, 11001110 decodes uniquely into the state sequence c, a, d. This relation between entropy and shortest coding length is a general one. The noiseless coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) states that the entropy is a lower bound on the number of bits needed to transmit the state of a random variable. From now on, we shall switch to the use of natural logarithms in de\ufb01ning en- tropy, as this will provide a more convenient link with ideas elsewhere in this book. In this case, the entropy is measured in units of \u2018nats\u2019 instead of bits, which differ simply by a factor of ln 2. We have introduced the concept of entropy in terms of the average amount of information needed to specify the state of a random variable. In fact, the concept of entropy has much earlier origins in physics where it was introduced in the context of equilibrium thermodynamics and later given a deeper interpretation as a measure of disorder through developments in statistical mechanics. We can understand this alternative view of entropy by considering a set of N identical objects that are to be divided amongst a set of bins, such that there are ni objects in the ith bin. Consider",

There are N ways to choose the \ufb01rst object, (N \u22121) ways to choose the second object, and so on, leading to a total of N! ways to allocate all N objects to the bins, where N! (pronounced \u2018factorial N\u2019) denotes the product N \u00d7(N \u22121)\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d72\u00d71. However, we don\u2019t wish to distinguish between rearrangements of objects within each bin. In the ith bin there are ni! ways of reordering the objects, and so the total number of ways of allocating the N objects to the bins is given by W = N! \u0015 i ni! (1.94) which is called the multiplicity. The entropy is then de\ufb01ned as the logarithm of the multiplicity scaled by an appropriate constant H = 1 N ln W = 1 N ln N! \u22121 N \u0002 i ln ni!. (1.95) We now consider the limit N \u2192\u221e, in which the fractions ni/N are held \ufb01xed, and apply Stirling\u2019s approximation ln N! \u2243N ln N \u2212N (1.96) which gives H = \u2212lim N\u2192\u221e \u0002 i \u0011ni N \u0012 ln \u0011ni N \u0012 = \u2212 \u0002 i pi ln pi (1.97) where we have used \u0005 i ni = N. Here pi = limN\u2192\u221e(ni/N) is the probability of an object being assigned to the ith bin. In physics terminology, the speci\ufb01c ar- rangements of objects in the bins is called a microstate, and the overall distribution of occupation numbers, expressed through the ratios ni/N, is called a macrostate. The multiplicity W is also known as the weight of the macrostate. We can interpret the bins as the states xi of a discrete random variable X, where p(X = xi) = pi. The entropy of the random variable X is then H[p] = \u2212 \u0002 i p(xi) ln p(xi). (1.98) Distributions p(xi) that are sharply peaked around a few values will have a relatively low entropy, whereas those that are spread more evenly across many values will have higher entropy, as illustrated in Figure 1.30. Because 0 \u2a7dpi \u2a7d1, the entropy is nonnegative, and it will equal its minimum value of 0 when one of the pi = 1 and all other pj\u0338=i = 0. The maximum entropy con\ufb01guration can be found by maximizing H using a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the normalization constraint Appendix E on the probabilities.

The corresponding value of the entropy is then H = ln M. This result can also be derived from Jensen\u2019s inequality (to be discussed shortly). To verify that the stationary point is indeed a maximum, we can Exercise 1.29 evaluate the second derivative of the entropy, which gives \u2202\u0004H \u2202p(xi)\u2202p(xj) = \u2212Iij 1 pi (1.100) where Iij are the elements of the identity matrix. We can extend the de\ufb01nition of entropy to include distributions p(x) over con- tinuous variables x as follows. First divide x into bins of width \u2206. Then, assuming p(x) is continuous, the mean value theorem (Weisstein, 1999) tells us that, for each such bin, there must exist a value xi such that \u0006 (i+1)\u2206 i\u2206 p(x) dx = p(xi)\u2206. (1.101) We can now quantize the continuous variable x by assigning any value x to the value xi whenever x falls in the ith bin. The probability of observing the value xi is then p(xi)\u2206. This gives a discrete distribution for which the entropy takes the form H\u2206= \u2212 \u0002 i p(xi)\u2206ln (p(xi)\u2206) = \u2212 \u0002 i p(xi)\u2206ln p(xi) \u2212ln \u2206 (1.102) where we have used \u0005 i p(xi)\u2206= 1, which follows from (1.101).

We see that the discrete and continuous forms of the entropy differ by a quantity ln \u2206, which diverges in the limit \u2206\u21920. This re\ufb02ects the fact that to specify a continuous variable very precisely requires a large number of bits. For a density de\ufb01ned over multiple continuous variables, denoted collectively by the vector x, the differential entropy is given by H[x] = \u2212 \u0006 p(x) ln p(x) dx. (1.104) In the case of discrete distributions, we saw that the maximum entropy con- \ufb01guration corresponded to an equal distribution of probabilities across the possible states of the variable. Let us now consider the maximum entropy con\ufb01guration for a continuous variable. In order for this maximum to be well de\ufb01ned, it will be nec- essary to constrain the \ufb01rst and second moments of p(x) as well as preserving the normalization constraint. We therefore maximize the differential entropy with the Ludwig Boltzmann 1844\u20131906 Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann was an Austrian physicist who created the \ufb01eld of statistical mechanics. Prior to Boltzmann, the concept of en- tropy was already known from classical thermodynamics where it quanti\ufb01es the fact that when we take energy from a system, not all of that energy is typically available to do useful work. Boltzmann showed that the ther- modynamic entropy S, a macroscopic quantity, could be related to the statistical properties at the micro- scopic level. This is expressed through the famous equation S = k ln W in which W represents the number of possible microstates in a macrostate, and k \u22431.38 \u00d7 10\u221223 (in units of Joules per Kelvin) is known as Boltzmann\u2019s constant. Boltzmann\u2019s ideas were disputed by many scientists of they day. One dif- \ufb01culty they saw arose from the second law of thermo- dynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system tends to increase with time. By contrast, at the microscopic level the classical Newtonian equa- tions of physics are reversible, and so they found it dif\ufb01cult to see how the latter could explain the for- mer. They didn\u2019t fully appreciate Boltzmann\u2019s argu- ments, which were statistical in nature and which con- cluded not that entropy could never decrease over time but simply that with overwhelming probability it would generally increase. Boltzmann even had a long- running dispute with the editor of the leading German physics journal who refused to let him refer to atoms and molecules as anything other than convenient the- oretical constructs. The continued attacks on his work lead to bouts of depression, and eventually he com- mitted suicide. Shortly after Boltzmann\u2019s death, new experiments by Perrin on colloidal suspensions veri- \ufb01ed his theories and con\ufb01rmed the value of the Boltz- mann constant. The equation S = k ln W is carved on Boltzmann\u2019s tombstone.",

Using the calculus of variations, we set the derivative of this functional to zero giving Appendix D p(x) = exp \u001a \u22121 + \u03bb1 + \u03bb2x + \u03bb3(x \u2212\u00b5)2\u001b . (1.108) The Lagrange multipliers can be found by back substitution of this result into the three constraint equations, leading \ufb01nally to the result Exercise 1.34 p(x) = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c32)1/2 exp \u2212(x \u2212\u00b5)2 2\u03c32 (1.109) and so the distribution that maximizes the differential entropy is the Gaussian. Note that we did not constrain the distribution to be nonnegative when we maximized the entropy. However, because the resulting distribution is indeed nonnegative, we see with hindsight that such a constraint is not necessary. If we evaluate the differential entropy of the Gaussian, we obtain Exercise 1.35 H[x] = 1 2 \u001a 1 + ln(2\u03c0\u03c32)\u001b . (1.110) Thus we see again that the entropy increases as the distribution becomes broader, i.e., as \u03c32 increases. This result also shows that the differential entropy, unlike the discrete entropy, can be negative, because H(x) < 0 in (1.110) for \u03c32 < 1/(2\u03c0e). Suppose we have a joint distribution p(x, y) from which we draw pairs of values of x and y. If a value of x is already known, then the additional information needed to specify the corresponding value of y is given by \u2212ln p(y|x). Thus the average additional information needed to specify y can be written as H[y|x] = \u2212 \u0006\u0006 p(y, x) ln p(y|x) dy dx (1.111)",

It is easily seen, using the product rule, that the conditional entropy satis\ufb01es the relation Exercise 1.37 H[x, y] = H[y|x] + H[x] (1.112) where H[x, y] is the differential entropy of p(x, y) and H[x] is the differential en- tropy of the marginal distribution p(x). Thus the information needed to describe x and y is given by the sum of the information needed to describe x alone plus the additional information required to specify y given x. 1.6.1 Relative entropy and mutual information So far in this section, we have introduced a number of concepts from information theory, including the key notion of entropy. We now start to relate these ideas to pattern recognition. Consider some unknown distribution p(x), and suppose that we have modelled this using an approximating distribution q(x). If we use q(x) to construct a coding scheme for the purpose of transmitting values of x to a receiver, then the average additional amount of information (in nats) required to specify the value of x (assuming we choose an ef\ufb01cient coding scheme) as a result of using q(x) instead of the true distribution p(x) is given by KL(p\u2225q) = \u2212 \u0006 p(x) ln q(x) dx \u2212 \u000f \u2212 \u0006 p(x) ln p(x) dx \u0010 = \u2212 \u0006 p(x) ln q(x) p(x) dx. (1.113) This is known as the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, or KL diver- gence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), between the distributions p(x) and q(x). Note that it is not a symmetrical quantity, that is to say KL(p\u2225q) \u0338\u2261KL(q\u2225p). We now show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence satis\ufb01es KL(p\u2225q) \u2a7e0 with equality if, and only if, p(x) = q(x). To do this we \ufb01rst introduce the concept of convex functions. A function f(x) is said to be convex if it has the property that every chord lies on or above the function, as shown in Figure 1.31. Any value of x in the interval from x = a to x = b can be written in the form \u03bba + (1 \u2212\u03bb)b where 0 \u2a7d\u03bb \u2a7d1.

(1.114) This is equivalent to the requirement that the second derivative of the function be everywhere positive. Examples of convex functions are x ln x (for x > 0) and x2. A Exercise 1.36 function is called strictly convex if the equality is satis\ufb01ed only for \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 1. If a function has the opposite property, namely that every chord lies on or below the function, it is called concave, with a corresponding de\ufb01nition for strictly concave. If a function f(x) is convex, then \u2212f(x) will be concave.

In fact, \u2212ln x is a strictly convex function, so the equality will hold if, and only if, q(x) = p(x) for all x. Thus we can in- terpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of the dissimilarity of the two distributions p(x) and q(x). We see that there is an intimate relationship between data compression and den- sity estimation (i.e., the problem of modelling an unknown probability distribution) because the most ef\ufb01cient compression is achieved when we know the true distri- bution. If we use a distribution that is different from the true one, then we must necessarily have a less ef\ufb01cient coding, and on average the additional information that must be transmitted is (at least) equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence be- tween the two distributions.

One way to determine \u03b8 is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between p(x) and q(x|\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8. We cannot do this directly because we don\u2019t know p(x). Suppose, however, that we have observed a \ufb01nite set of training points xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, drawn from p(x). Then the expectation with respect to p(x) can be approximated by a \ufb01nite sum over these points, using (1.35), so that KL(p\u2225q) \u2243 N \u0002 n=1 {\u2212ln q(xn|\u03b8) + ln p(xn)} . (1.119) The second term on the right-hand side of (1.119) is independent of \u03b8, and the \ufb01rst term is the negative log likelihood function for \u03b8 under the distribution q(x|\u03b8) eval- uated using the training set. Thus we see that minimizing this Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function. Now consider the joint distribution between two sets of variables x and y given by p(x, y). If the sets of variables are independent, then their joint distribution will factorize into the product of their marginals p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). If the variables are not independent, we can gain some idea of whether they are \u2018close\u2019 to being indepen- dent by considering the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution and the product of the marginals, given by I[x, y] \u2261 KL(p(x, y)\u2225p(x)p(y)) = \u2212 \u0006\u0006 p(x, y) ln \u000fp(x)p(y) p(x, y) \u0010 dx dy (1.120) which is called the mutual information between the variables x and y. From the properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we see that I(x, y) \u2a7e0 with equal- ity if, and only if, x and y are independent. Using the sum and product rules of probability, we see that the mutual information is related to the conditional entropy through Exercise 1.41 I[x, y] = H[x] \u2212H[x|y] = H[y] \u2212H[y|x].

We turn now to an exploration of some particular examples of probability distributions and their properties. As well as be- ing of great interest in their own right, these distributions can form building blocks for more complex models and will be used extensively throughout the book. The distributions introduced in this chapter will also serve another important purpose, namely to provide us with the opportunity to discuss some key statistical concepts, such as Bayesian inference, in the context of simple models before we encounter them in more complex situations in later chapters. One role for the distributions discussed in this chapter is to model the prob- ability distribution p(x) of a random variable x, given a \ufb01nite set x1, . . . , xN of observations. This problem is known as density estimation. For the purposes of this chapter, we shall assume that the data points are independent and identically distributed.

Indeed, any distribution p(x) that is nonzero at each of the data points x1, . . . , xN is a potential candidate. The issue of choosing an appropriate distribution relates to the problem of model selec- tion that has already been encountered in the context of polynomial curve \ufb01tting in Chapter 1 and that is a central issue in pattern recognition. We begin by considering the binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete random variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables. These are speci\ufb01c examples of parametric distributions, so-called because they are governed by a small number of adaptive parameters, such as the mean and variance in the case of a Gaussian for example. To apply such models to the problem of density estimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters, given an observed data set. In a frequentist treatment, we choose speci\ufb01c values for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By contrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters and then use Bayes\u2019 theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution given the observed data. We shall see that an important role is played by conjugate priors, that lead to posterior distributions having the same functional form as the prior, and that there- fore lead to a greatly simpli\ufb01ed Bayesian analysis. For example, the conjugate prior for the parameters of the multinomial distribution is called the Dirichlet distribution, while the conjugate prior for the mean of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. All of these distributions are examples of the exponential family of distributions, which possess a number of important properties, and which will be discussed in some detail. One limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a speci\ufb01c functional form for the distribution, which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular application. An alternative approach is given by nonparametric density estimation methods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data set. Such models still contain parameters, but these control the model complexity rather than the form of the distribution. We end this chapter by considering three nonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and kernels. 2.1. Binary Variables We begin by considering a single binary random variable x \u2208{0, 1}. For example, x might describe the outcome of \ufb02ipping a coin, with x = 1 representing \u2018heads\u2019, and x = 0 representing \u2018tails\u2019. We can imagine that this is a damaged coin so that the probability of landing heads is not necessarily the same as that of landing tails. The probability of x = 1 will be denoted by the parameter \u00b5 so that p(x = 1|\u00b5) = \u00b5 (2.1)",

The probability distribution over x can therefore be written in the form Bern(x|\u00b5) = \u00b5x(1 \u2212\u00b5)1\u2212x (2.2) which is known as the Bernoulli distribution. It is easily veri\ufb01ed that this distribution Exercise 2.1 is normalized and that it has mean and variance given by E[x] = \u00b5 (2.3) var[x] = \u00b5(1 \u2212\u00b5). (2.4) Now suppose we have a data set D = {x1, . . . , xN} of observed values of x. We can construct the likelihood function, which is a function of \u00b5, on the assumption that the observations are drawn independently from p(x|\u00b5), so that p(D|\u00b5) = N \u000e n=1 p(xn|\u00b5) = N \u000e n=1 \u00b5xn(1 \u2212\u00b5)1\u2212xn. (2.5) In a frequentist setting, we can estimate a value for \u00b5 by maximizing the likelihood function, or equivalently by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood. In the case of the Bernoulli distribution, the log likelihood function is given by ln p(D|\u00b5) = N \u0002 n=1 ln p(xn|\u00b5) = N \u0002 n=1 {xn ln \u00b5 + (1 \u2212xn) ln(1 \u2212\u00b5)} . (2.6) At this point, it is worth noting that the log likelihood function depends on the N observations xn only through their sum \u0005 n xn. This sum provides an example of a suf\ufb01cient statistic for the data under this distribution, and we shall study the impor- tant role of suf\ufb01cient statistics in some detail.

If we denote the number of observations of x = 1 (heads) within this data set by m, then we can write (2.7) in the form \u00b5ML = m N (2.8) so that the probability of landing heads is given, in this maximum likelihood frame- work, by the fraction of observations of heads in the data set. Now suppose we \ufb02ip a coin, say, 3 times and happen to observe 3 heads. Then N = m = 3 and \u00b5ML = 1. In this case, the maximum likelihood result would predict that all future observations should give heads. Common sense tells us that this is unreasonable, and in fact this is an extreme example of the over-\ufb01tting associ- ated with maximum likelihood. We shall see shortly how to arrive at more sensible conclusions through the introduction of a prior distribution over \u00b5. We can also work out the distribution of the number m of observations of x = 1, given that the data set has size N. This is called the binomial distribution, and from (2.5) we see that it is proportional to \u00b5m(1 \u2212\u00b5)N\u2212m.

The mean and variance of the binomial distribution can be found by using the result of Exercise 1.10, which shows that for independent events the mean of the sum is the sum of the means, and the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.

(2.12) These results can also be proved directly using calculus. Exercise 2.4 2.1.1 The beta distribution We have seen in (2.8) that the maximum likelihood setting for the parameter \u00b5 in the Bernoulli distribution, and hence in the binomial distribution, is given by the fraction of the observations in the data set having x = 1. As we have already noted, this can give severely over-\ufb01tted results for small data sets. In order to develop a Bayesian treatment for this problem, we need to introduce a prior distribution p(\u00b5) over the parameter \u00b5. Here we consider a form of prior distribution that has a simple interpretation as well as some useful analytical properties. To motivate this prior, we note that the likelihood function takes the form of the product of factors of the form \u00b5x(1 \u2212\u00b5)1\u2212x. If we choose a prior to be proportional to powers of \u00b5 and (1 \u2212\u00b5), then the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood function, will have the same functional form as the prior. This property is called conjugacy and we will see several examples of it later in this chapter. We therefore choose a prior, called the beta distribution, given by Beta(\u00b5|a, b) = \u0393(a + b) \u0393(a)\u0393(b)\u00b5a\u22121(1 \u2212\u00b5)b\u22121 (2.13) where \u0393(x) is the gamma function de\ufb01ned by (1.141), and the coef\ufb01cient in (2.13) ensures that the beta distribution is normalized, so that Exercise 2.5 \u0006 1 0 Beta(\u00b5|a, b) d\u00b5 = 1. (2.14) The mean and variance of the beta distribution are given by Exercise 2.6 E[\u00b5] = a a + b (2.15) var[\u00b5] = ab (a + b)2(a + b + 1). (2.16) The parameters a and b are often called hyperparameters because they control the distribution of the parameter \u00b5. Figure 2.2 shows plots of the beta distribution for various values of the hyperparameters. The posterior distribution of \u00b5 is now obtained by multiplying the beta prior (2.13) by the binomial likelihood function (2.9) and normalizing. Keeping only the factors that depend on \u00b5, we see that this posterior distribution has the form p(\u00b5|m, l, a, b) \u221d\u00b5m+a\u22121(1 \u2212\u00b5)l+b\u22121 (2.17)",

We see that (2.17) has the same functional dependence on \u00b5 as the prior distribution, re\ufb02ecting the conjugacy properties of the prior with respect to the like- lihood function. Indeed, it is simply another beta distribution, and its normalization coef\ufb01cient can therefore be obtained by comparison with (2.13) to give p(\u00b5|m, l, a, b) = \u0393(m + a + l + b) \u0393(m + a)\u0393(l + b)\u00b5m+a\u22121(1 \u2212\u00b5)l+b\u22121. (2.18) We see that the effect of observing a data set of m observations of x = 1 and l observations of x = 0 has been to increase the value of a by m, and the value of b by l, in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. This allows us to provide a simple interpretation of the hyperparameters a and b in the prior as an effective number of observations of x = 1 and x = 0, respectively. Note that a and b need not be integers. Furthermore, the posterior distribution can act as the prior if we subsequently observe additional data. To see this, we can imagine taking observations one at a time and after each observation updating the current posterior",

At each stage, the posterior is a beta distribution with some total number of (prior and actual) observed values for x = 1 and x = 0 given by the parameters a and b. Incorporation of an additional observation of x = 1 simply corresponds to incrementing the value of a by 1, whereas for an observation of x = 0 we increment b by 1. Figure 2.3 illustrates one step in this process. We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood function and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d. data. Sequential methods make use of observations one at a time, or in small batches, and then discard them before the next observations are used. They can be used, for example, in real-time learning scenarios where a steady stream of data is arriving, and predictions must be made before all of the data is seen. Because they do not require the whole data set to be stored or loaded into memory, sequential methods are also useful for large data sets. Maximum likelihood methods can also be cast into a sequential framework. Section 2.3.5 If our goal is to predict, as best we can, the outcome of the next trial, then we must evaluate the predictive distribution of x, given the observed data set D. From the sum and product rules of probability, this takes the form p(x = 1|D) = \u0006 1 0 p(x = 1|\u00b5)p(\u00b5|D) d\u00b5 = \u0006 1 0 \u00b5p(\u00b5|D) d\u00b5 = E[\u00b5|D]. (2.19) Using the result (2.18) for the posterior distribution p(\u00b5|D), together with the result (2.15) for the mean of the beta distribution, we obtain p(x = 1|D) = m + a m + a + l + b (2.20) which has a simple interpretation as the total fraction of observations (both real ob- servations and \ufb01ctitious prior observations) that correspond to x = 1. Note that in the limit of an in\ufb01nitely large data set m, l \u2192\u221ethe result (2.20) reduces to the maximum likelihood result (2.8). As we shall see, it is a very general property that the Bayesian and maximum likelihood results will agree in the limit of an in\ufb01nitely",

For a \ufb01nite data set, the posterior mean for \u00b5 always lies between the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for \u00b5 corresponding to the relative frequencies of events given by (2.7). Exercise 2.7 From Figure 2.2, we see that as the number of observations increases, so the posterior distribution becomes more sharply peaked. This can also be seen from the result (2.16) for the variance of the beta distribution, in which we see that the variance goes to zero for a \u2192\u221eor b \u2192\u221e. In fact, we might wonder whether it is a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease. To address this, we can take a frequentist view of Bayesian learning and show that, on average, such a property does indeed hold. Consider a general Bayesian inference problem for a parameter \u03b8 for which we have observed a data set D, de- scribed by the joint distribution p(\u03b8, D). The following result Exercise 2.8 E\u03b8[\u03b8] = ED [E\u03b8[\u03b8|D]] (2.21) where E\u03b8[\u03b8] \u2261 \u0006 p(\u03b8)\u03b8 d\u03b8 (2.22) ED[E\u03b8[\u03b8|D]] \u2261 \u0006 \u0006 \u03b8p(\u03b8|D) d\u03b8 p(D) dD (2.23) says that the posterior mean of \u03b8, averaged over the distribution generating the data, is equal to the prior mean of \u03b8. Similarly, we can show that var\u03b8[\u03b8] = ED [var\u03b8[\u03b8|D]] + varD [E\u03b8[\u03b8|D]] . (2.24) The term on the left-hand side of (2.24) is the prior variance of \u03b8. On the right- hand side, the \ufb01rst term is the average posterior variance of \u03b8, and the second term measures the variance in the posterior mean of \u03b8. Because this variance is a positive quantity, this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of \u03b8 is smaller than the prior variance. The reduction in variance is greater if the variance in the posterior mean is greater. Note, however, that this result only holds on average, and that for a particular observed data set it is possible for the posterior variance to be larger than the prior variance. 2.2. Multinomial Variables Binary variables can be used to describe quantities that can take one of two possible values. Often, however, we encounter discrete variables that can take on one of K possible mutually exclusive states. Although there are various alternative ways to express such variables, we shall see shortly that a particularly convenient represen- tation is the 1-of-K scheme in which the variable is represented by a K-dimensional vector x in which one of the elements xk equals 1, and all remaining elements equal",

So, for instance if we have a variable that can take K = 6 states and a particular observation of the variable happens to correspond to the state where x3 = 1, then x will be represented by x = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T. (2.25) Note that such vectors satisfy \u0005K k=1 xk = 1. If we denote the probability of xk = 1 by the parameter \u00b5k, then the distribution of x is given p(x|\u00b5) = K \u000e k=1 \u00b5xk k (2.26) where \u00b5 = (\u00b51, . . . , \u00b5K)T, and the parameters \u00b5k are constrained to satisfy \u00b5k \u2a7e0 and \u0005 k \u00b5k = 1, because they represent probabilities. The distribution (2.26) can be regarded as a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution to more than two outcomes. It is easily seen that the distribution is normalized \u0002 x p(x|\u00b5) = K \u0002 k=1 \u00b5k = 1 (2.27) and that E[x|\u00b5] = \u0002 x p(x|\u00b5)x = (\u00b51, . . . , \u00b5M)T = \u00b5.

This allows us to determine the normalization coef\ufb01cient by comparison with (2.38) so that p(\u00b5|D, \u03b1) = Dir(\u00b5|\u03b1 + m) = \u0393(\u03b10 + N) \u0393(\u03b11 + m1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0393(\u03b1K + mK) K \u000e k=1 \u00b5\u03b1k+mk\u22121 k (2.41) where we have denoted m = (m1, . . . , mK)T. As for the case of the binomial distribution with its beta prior, we can interpret the parameters \u03b1k of the Dirichlet prior as an effective number of observations of xk = 1. Note that two-state quantities can either be represented as binary variables and Lejeune Dirichlet 1805\u20131859 Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet was a modest and re- served mathematician who made contributions in number theory, me- chanics, and astronomy, and who gave the \ufb01rst rigorous analysis of Fourier series. His family originated from Richelet in Belgium, and the name Lejeune Dirichlet comes from \u2018le jeune de Richelet\u2019 (the young person from Richelet). Dirichlet\u2019s \ufb01rst paper, which was published in 1825, brought him instant fame. It concerned Fer- mat\u2019s last theorem, which claims that there are no positive integer solutions to xn + yn = zn for n > 2. Dirichlet gave a partial proof for the case n = 5, which was sent to Legendre for review and who in turn com- pleted the proof. Later, Dirichlet gave a complete proof for n = 14, although a full proof of Fermat\u2019s last theo- rem for arbitrary n had to wait until the work of Andrew Wiles in the closing years of the 20th century.",

The Gaussian Distribution The Gaussian, also known as the normal distribution, is a widely used model for the distribution of continuous variables. In the case of a single variable x, the Gaussian distribution can be written in the form N (x|\u00b5, \u03c32) = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c32)1/2 exp \u0001 \u22121 2\u03c32(x \u2212\u00b5)2 \u0002 (2.42) where \u00b5 is the mean and \u03c32 is the variance. For a D-dimensional vector x, the multivariate Gaussian distribution takes the form N (x|\u00b5, \u03a3) = 1 (2\u03c0)D/2 1 |\u03a3|1/2 exp \u0001 \u22121 2(x \u2212\u00b5)T\u03a3\u22121(x \u2212\u00b5) \u0002 (2.43) where \u00b5 is a D-dimensional mean vector, \u03a3 is a D \u00d7 D covariance matrix, and |\u03a3| denotes the determinant of \u03a3. The Gaussian distribution arises in many different contexts and can be motivated from a variety of different perspectives. For example, we have already seen that for Section 1.6 a single real variable, the distribution that maximizes the entropy is the Gaussian. This property applies also to the multivariate Gaussian. Exercise 2.14 Another situation in which the Gaussian distribution arises is when we consider the sum of multiple random variables. The central limit theorem (due to Laplace) tells us that, subject to certain mild conditions, the sum of a set of random variables, which is of course itself a random variable, has a distribution that becomes increas- ingly Gaussian as the number of terms in the sum increases (Walker, 1969).

For large N, this distribution tends to a Gaussian, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. In practice, the convergence to a Gaussian as N increases can be very rapid. One consequence of this result is that the binomial distribution (2.9), which is a distribution over m de\ufb01ned by the sum of N observations of the random binary variable x, will tend to a Gaussian as N \u2192\u221e(see Figure 2.1 for the case of N = 10). The Gaussian distribution has many important analytical properties, and we shall consider several of these in detail. As a result, this section will be rather more tech- nically involved than some of the earlier sections, and will require familiarity with various matrix identities. However, we strongly encourage the reader to become pro- Appendix C \ufb01cient in manipulating Gaussian distributions using the techniques presented here as this will prove invaluable in understanding the more complex models presented in later chapters. We begin by considering the geometrical form of the Gaussian distribution. The Carl Friedrich Gauss 1777\u20131855 It is said that when Gauss went to elementary school at age 7, his teacher B\u00a8uttner, trying to keep the class occupied, asked the pupils to sum the integers from 1 to 100. To the teacher\u2019s amazement, Gauss arrived at the answer in a matter of moments by noting that the sum can be represented as 50 pairs (1 + 100, 2+99, etc.) each of which added to 101, giving the an- swer 5,050. It is now believed that the problem which was actually set was of the same form but somewhat harder in that the sequence had a larger starting value and a larger increment. Gauss was a German math- ematician and scientist with a reputation for being a hard-working perfectionist. One of his many contribu- tions was to show that least squares can be derived under the assumption of normally distributed errors. He also created an early formulation of non-Euclidean geometry (a self-consistent geometrical theory that vi- olates the axioms of Euclid) but was reluctant to dis- cuss it openly for fear that his reputation might suffer if it were seen that he believed in such a geometry. At one point, Gauss was asked to conduct a geodetic survey of the state of Hanover, which led to his for- mulation of the normal distribution, now also known as the Gaussian. After his death, a study of his di- aries revealed that he had discovered several impor- tant mathematical results years or even decades be- fore they were published by others.",

The quantity \u2206is called the Mahalanobis distance from \u00b5 to x and reduces to the Euclidean distance when \u03a3 is the identity matrix. The Gaussian distribution will be constant on surfaces in x-space for which this quadratic form is constant. First of all, we note that the matrix \u03a3 can be taken to be symmetric, without loss of generality, because any antisymmetric component would disappear from the exponent. Now consider the eigenvector equation for the covariance matrix Exercise 2.17 \u03a3ui = \u03bbiui (2.45) where i = 1, . . . , D. Because \u03a3 is a real, symmetric matrix its eigenvalues will be real, and its eigenvectors can be chosen to form an orthonormal set, so that Exercise 2.18 uT i uj = Iij (2.46) where Iij is the i, j element of the identity matrix and satis\ufb01es Iij = 1, if i = j 0, otherwise.

The quadratic form, and hence the Gaussian density, will be constant on surfaces for which (2.51) is constant. If all of the eigenvalues \u03bbi are positive, then these surfaces represent ellipsoids, with their centres at \u00b5 and their axes oriented along ui, and with scaling factors in the directions of the axes given by \u03bb1/2 i , as illustrated in Figure 2.7. For the Gaussian distribution to be well de\ufb01ned, it is necessary for all of the eigenvalues \u03bbi of the covariance matrix to be strictly positive, otherwise the dis- tribution cannot be properly normalized. A matrix whose eigenvalues are strictly positive is said to be positive de\ufb01nite. In Chapter 12, we will encounter Gaussian distributions for which one or more of the eigenvalues are zero, in which case the distribution is singular and is con\ufb01ned to a subspace of lower dimensionality. If all of the eigenvalues are nonnegative, then the covariance matrix is said to be positive semide\ufb01nite.

We now look at the moments of the Gaussian distribution and thereby provide an interpretation of the parameters \u00b5 and \u03a3.

We now note that the exponent is an even function of the components of z and, because the integrals over these are taken over the range (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), the term in z in the factor (z + \u00b5) will vanish by symmetry. Thus E[x] = \u00b5 (2.59) and so we refer to \u00b5 as the mean of the Gaussian distribution. We now consider second order moments of the Gaussian. In the univariate case, we considered the second order moment given by E[x2]. For the multivariate Gaus- sian, there are D2 second order moments given by E[xixj], which we can group together to form the matrix E[xxT].

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS Figure 2.8 Contours of constant probability density for a Gaussian distribution in two dimensions in which the covariance matrix is (a) of general form, (b) diagonal, in which the elliptical contours are aligned with the coordinate axes, and (c) proportional to the identity matrix, in which the contours are concentric circles. x1 x2 (a) x1 x2 (b) x1 x2 (c) therefore grows quadratically with D, and the computational task of manipulating and inverting large matrices can become prohibitive. One way to address this prob- lem is to use restricted forms of the covariance matrix. If we consider covariance matrices that are diagonal, so that \u03a3 = diag(\u03c32 i ), we then have a total of 2D inde- pendent parameters in the density model. The corresponding contours of constant density are given by axis-aligned ellipsoids. We could further restrict the covariance matrix to be proportional to the identity matrix, \u03a3 = \u03c32I, known as an isotropic co- variance, giving D + 1 independent parameters in the model and spherical surfaces of constant density. The three possibilities of general, diagonal, and isotropic covari- ance matrices are illustrated in Figure 2.8. Unfortunately, whereas such approaches limit the number of degrees of freedom in the distribution and make inversion of the covariance matrix a much faster operation, they also greatly restrict the form of the probability density and limit its ability to capture interesting correlations in the data. A further limitation of the Gaussian distribution is that it is intrinsically uni- modal (i.e., has a single maximum) and so is unable to provide a good approximation to multimodal distributions. Thus the Gaussian distribution can be both too \ufb02exible, in the sense of having too many parameters, while also being too limited in the range of distributions that it can adequately represent. We will see later that the introduc- tion of latent variables, also called hidden variables or unobserved variables, allows both of these problems to be addressed. In particular, a rich family of multimodal distributions is obtained by introducing discrete latent variables leading to mixtures of Gaussians, as discussed in Section 2.3.9. Similarly, the introduction of continuous latent variables, as described in Chapter 12, leads to models in which the number of free parameters can be controlled independently of the dimensionality D of the data space while still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data set. Indeed, these two approaches can be combined and further extended to derive a very rich set of hierarchical models that can be adapted to a broad range of prac- tical applications. For instance, the Gaussian version of the Markov random \ufb01eld, Section 8.3 which is widely used as a probabilistic model of images, is a Gaussian distribution over the joint space of pixel intensities but rendered tractable through the imposition of considerable structure re\ufb02ecting the spatial organization of the pixels. Similarly, the linear dynamical system, used to model time series data for applications such Section 13.3 as tracking, is also a joint Gaussian distribution over a potentially large number of observed and latent variables and again is tractable due to the structure imposed on the distribution.

The Gaussian Distribution 85 such complex distributions is that of probabilistic graphical models, which will form the subject of Chapter 8. 2.3.1 Conditional Gaussian distributions An important property of the multivariate Gaussian distribution is that if two sets of variables are jointly Gaussian, then the conditional distribution of one set conditioned on the other is again Gaussian. Similarly, the marginal distribution of either set is also Gaussian. Consider \ufb01rst the case of conditional distributions. Suppose x is a D-dimensional vector with Gaussian distribution N(x|\u00b5, \u03a3) and that we partition x into two dis- joint subsets xa and xb. Without loss of generality, we can take xa to form the \ufb01rst M components of x, with xb comprising the remaining D \u2212M components, so that x = \u000f xa xb \u0010 . (2.65) We also de\ufb01ne corresponding partitions of the mean vector \u00b5 given by \u00b5 = \u000f \u00b5a \u00b5b \u0010 (2.66) and of the covariance matrix \u03a3 given by \u03a3 = \u000f \u03a3aa \u03a3ab \u03a3ba \u03a3bb \u0010 . (2.67) Note that the symmetry \u03a3T = \u03a3 of the covariance matrix implies that \u03a3aa and \u03a3bb are symmetric, while \u03a3ba = \u03a3T ab. In many situations, it will be convenient to work with the inverse of the covari- ance matrix \u039b \u2261\u03a3\u22121 (2.68) which is known as the precision matrix. In fact, we shall see that some properties of Gaussian distributions are most naturally expressed in terms of the covariance, whereas others take a simpler form when viewed in terms of the precision. We therefore also introduce the partitioned form of the precision matrix \u039b = \u000f \u039baa \u039bab \u039bba \u039bbb \u0010 (2.69) corresponding to the partitioning (2.65) of the vector x.

It should be stressed at this point that, for instance, \u039baa is not simply given by the inverse of \u03a3aa. In fact, we shall shortly examine the relation between the inverse of a partitioned matrix and the inverses of its partitions.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS evaluated from the joint distribution p(x) = p(xa, xb) simply by \ufb01xing xb to the observed value and normalizing the resulting expression to obtain a valid probability distribution over xa.

(2.70) We see that as a function of xa, this is again a quadratic form, and hence the cor- responding conditional distribution p(xa|xb) will be Gaussian. Because this distri- bution is completely characterized by its mean and its covariance, our goal will be to identify expressions for the mean and covariance of p(xa|xb) by inspection of (2.70). This is an example of a rather common operation associated with Gaussian distributions, sometimes called \u2018completing the square\u2019, in which we are given a quadratic form de\ufb01ning the exponent terms in a Gaussian distribution, and we need to determine the corresponding mean and covariance. Such problems can be solved straightforwardly by noting that the exponent in a general Gaussian distribution N(x|\u00b5, \u03a3) can be written \u22121 2(x \u2212\u00b5)T\u03a3\u22121(x \u2212\u00b5) = \u22121 2xT\u03a3\u22121x + xT\u03a3\u22121\u00b5 + const (2.71) where \u2018const\u2019 denotes terms which are independent of x, and we have made use of the symmetry of \u03a3. Thus if we take our general quadratic form and express it in the form given by the right-hand side of (2.71), then we can immediately equate the matrix of coef\ufb01cients entering the second order term in x to the inverse covariance matrix \u03a3\u22121 and the coef\ufb01cient of the linear term in x to \u03a3\u22121\u00b5, from which we can obtain \u00b5. Now let us apply this procedure to the conditional Gaussian distribution p(xa|xb) for which the quadratic form in the exponent is given by (2.70). We will denote the mean and covariance of this distribution by \u00b5a|b and \u03a3a|b, respectively. Consider the functional dependence of (2.70) on xa in which xb is regarded as a constant. If we pick out all terms that are second order in xa, we have \u22121 2xT a \u039baaxa (2.72) from which we can immediately conclude that the covariance (inverse precision) of p(xa|xb) is given by \u03a3a|b = \u039b\u22121 aa .

From our discussion of the general form (2.71), the coef\ufb01cient of xa in this expression must equal \u03a3\u22121 a|b\u00b5a|b and hence \u00b5a|b = \u03a3a|b {\u039baa\u00b5a \u2212\u039bab(xb \u2212\u00b5b)} = \u00b5a \u2212\u039b\u22121 aa \u039bab(xb \u2212\u00b5b) (2.75) where we have made use of (2.73). The results (2.73) and (2.75) are expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix of the original joint distribution p(xa, xb). We can also express these results in terms of the corresponding partitioned covariance matrix. To do this, we make use of the following identity for the inverse of a partitioned matrix Exercise 2.24 \u000f A B C D \u0010\u22121 = \u000f M \u2212MBD\u22121 \u2212D\u22121CM D\u22121 + D\u22121CMBD\u22121 \u0010 (2.76) where we have de\ufb01ned M = (A \u2212BD\u22121C)\u22121. (2.77) The quantity M\u22121 is known as the Schur complement of the matrix on the left-hand side of (2.76) with respect to the submatrix D. Using the de\ufb01nition \u000f \u03a3aa \u03a3ab \u03a3ba \u03a3bb \u0010\u22121 = \u000f \u039baa \u039bab \u039bba \u039bbb \u0010 (2.78) and making use of (2.76), we have \u039baa = (\u03a3aa \u2212\u03a3ab\u03a3\u22121 bb \u03a3ba)\u22121 (2.79) \u039bab = \u2212(\u03a3aa \u2212\u03a3ab\u03a3\u22121 bb \u03a3ba)\u22121\u03a3ab\u03a3\u22121 bb . (2.80) From these we obtain the following expressions for the mean and covariance of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) \u00b5a|b = \u00b5a + \u03a3ab\u03a3\u22121 bb (xb \u2212\u00b5b) (2.81) \u03a3a|b = \u03a3aa \u2212\u03a3ab\u03a3\u22121 bb \u03a3ba. (2.82) Comparing (2.73) and (2.82), we see that the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) takes a simpler form when expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix than when it is expressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Note that the mean of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb), given by (2.81), is a linear function of xb and that the covariance, given by (2.82), is independent of xa.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS 2.3.2 Marginal Gaussian distributions We have seen that if a joint distribution p(xa, xb) is Gaussian, then the condi- tional distribution p(xa|xb) will again be Gaussian. Now we turn to a discussion of the marginal distribution given by p(xa) = \u0006 p(xa, xb) dxb (2.83) which, as we shall see, is also Gaussian. Once again, our strategy for evaluating this distribution ef\ufb01ciently will be to focus on the quadratic form in the exponent of the joint distribution and thereby to identify the mean and covariance of the marginal distribution p(xa). The quadratic form for the joint distribution can be expressed, using the par- titioned precision matrix, in the form (2.70). Because our goal is to integrate out xb, this is most easily achieved by \ufb01rst considering the terms involving xb and then completing the square in order to facilitate integration. Picking out just those terms that involve xb, we have \u22121 2xT b \u039bbbxb+xT b m = \u22121 2(xb\u2212\u039b\u22121 bb m)T\u039bbb(xb\u2212\u039b\u22121 bb m)+1 2mT\u039b\u22121 bb m (2.84) where we have de\ufb01ned m = \u039bbb\u00b5b \u2212\u039bba(xa \u2212\u00b5a). (2.85) We see that the dependence on xb has been cast into the standard quadratic form of a Gaussian distribution corresponding to the \ufb01rst term on the right-hand side of (2.84), plus a term that does not depend on xb (but that does depend on xa). Thus, when we take the exponential of this quadratic form, we see that the integration over xb required by (2.83) will take the form \u0006 exp \u22121 2(xb \u2212\u039b\u22121 bb m)T\u039bbb(xb \u2212\u039b\u22121 bb m) dxb. (2.86) This integration is easily performed by noting that it is the integral over an unnor- malized Gaussian, and so the result will be the reciprocal of the normalization co- ef\ufb01cient. We know from the form of the normalized Gaussian given by (2.43), that this coef\ufb01cient is independent of the mean and depends only on the determinant of the covariance matrix. Thus, by completing the square with respect to xb, we can integrate out xb and the only term remaining from the contributions on the left-hand side of (2.84) that depends on xa is the last term on the right-hand side of (2.84) in which m is given by (2.85).

The covariance in (2.88) is expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix given by (2.69). We can rewrite this in terms of the corresponding partitioning of the covariance matrix given by (2.67), as we did for the conditional distribution. These partitioned matrices are related by \u000f \u039baa \u039bab \u039bba \u039bbb \u0010\u22121 = \u000f \u03a3aa \u03a3ab \u03a3ba \u03a3bb \u0010 (2.90) Making use of (2.76), we then have \u039baa \u2212\u039bab\u039b\u22121 bb \u039bba \u22121 = \u03a3aa. (2.91) Thus we obtain the intuitively satisfying result that the marginal distribution p(xa) has mean and covariance given by E[xa] = \u00b5a (2.92) cov[xa] = \u03a3aa. (2.93) We see that for a marginal distribution, the mean and covariance are most simply ex- pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix, in contrast to the conditional distribution for which the partitioned precision matrix gives rise to simpler expres- sions.

We wish to \ufb01nd the marginal distribution p(y) and the conditional distribution p(x|y). This is a problem that will arise frequently in subsequent chapters, and it will prove convenient to derive the general results here. We shall take the marginal and conditional distributions to be p(x) = N x|\u00b5, \u039b\u22121 (2.99) p(y|x) = N y|Ax + b, L\u22121 (2.100) where \u00b5, A, and b are parameters governing the means, and \u039b and L are precision matrices. If x has dimensionality M and y has dimensionality D, then the matrix A has size D \u00d7 M. First we \ufb01nd an expression for the joint distribution over x and y. To do this, we de\ufb01ne z = \u000f x y \u0010 (2.101) and then consider the log of the joint distribution ln p(z) = ln p(x) + ln p(y|x) = \u22121 2(x \u2212\u00b5)T\u039b(x \u2212\u00b5) \u22121 2(y \u2212Ax \u2212b)TL(y \u2212Ax \u2212b) + const (2.102) where \u2018const\u2019 denotes terms independent of x and y. As before, we see that this is a quadratic function of the components of z, and hence p(z) is Gaussian distribution. To \ufb01nd the precision of this Gaussian, we consider the second order terms in (2.102), which can be written as \u22121 2xT(\u039b + ATLA)x \u22121 2yTLy + 1 2yTLAx + 1 2xTATLy = \u22121 2 \u000f x y \u0010T \u000f \u039b + ATLA \u2212ATL \u2212LA L \u0010 \u000f x y \u0010 = \u22121 2zTRz (2.103) and so the Gaussian distribution over z has precision (inverse covariance) matrix given by R = \u000f \u039b + ATLA \u2212ATL \u2212LA L \u0010 . (2.104) The covariance matrix is found by taking the inverse of the precision, which can be done using the matrix inversion formula (2.76) to give Exercise 2.29 cov[z] = R\u22121 = \u000f \u039b\u22121 \u039b\u22121AT A\u039b\u22121 L\u22121 + A\u039b\u22121AT \u0010 .

(2.107) Making use of (2.105), we then obtain Exercise 2.30 E[z] = \u000f \u00b5 A\u00b5 + b \u0010 . (2.108) Next we \ufb01nd an expression for the marginal distribution p(y) in which we have marginalized over x. Recall that the marginal distribution over a subset of the com- ponents of a Gaussian random vector takes a particularly simple form when ex- pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Speci\ufb01cally, its mean and Section 2.3 covariance are given by (2.92) and (2.93), respectively. Making use of (2.105) and (2.108) we see that the mean and covariance of the marginal distribution p(y) are given by E[y] = A\u00b5 + b (2.109) cov[y] = L\u22121 + A\u039b\u22121AT. (2.110) A special case of this result is when A = I, in which case it reduces to the convolu- tion of two Gaussians, for which we see that the mean of the convolution is the sum of the mean of the two Gaussians, and the covariance of the convolution is the sum of their covariances. Finally, we seek an expression for the conditional p(x|y). Recall that the results for the conditional distribution are most easily expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix, using (2.73) and (2.75). Applying these results to (2.105) and Section 2.3 (2.108) we see that the conditional distribution p(x|y) has mean and covariance given by E[x|y] = (\u039b + ATLA)\u22121 \u001a ATL(y \u2212b) + \u039b\u00b5 \u001b (2.111) cov[x|y] = (\u039b + ATLA)\u22121. (2.112) The evaluation of this conditional can be seen as an example of Bayes\u2019 theorem. We can interpret the distribution p(x) as a prior distribution over x. If the variable y is observed, then the conditional distribution p(x|y) represents the corresponding posterior distribution over x. Having found the marginal and conditional distribu- tions, we effectively expressed the joint distribution p(z) = p(x)p(y|x) in the form p(x|y)p(y). These results are summarized below.",

The simplest approach is to ignore the symmetry constraint and show that the resulting solution is symmetric as required. Exercise 2.34 Alternative derivations of this result, which impose the symmetry and positive de\ufb01- niteness constraints explicitly, can be found in Magnus and Neudecker (1999). The result is as expected and takes the form \u03a3ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5ML)(xn \u2212\u00b5ML)T (2.122) which involves \u00b5ML because this is the result of a joint maximization with respect to \u00b5 and \u03a3. Note that the solution (2.121) for \u00b5ML does not depend on \u03a3ML, and so we can \ufb01rst evaluate \u00b5ML and then use this to evaluate \u03a3ML. If we evaluate the expectations of the maximum likelihood solutions under the true distribution, we obtain the following results Exercise 2.35 E[\u00b5ML] = \u00b5 (2.123) E[\u03a3ML] = N \u22121 N \u03a3. (2.124) We see that the expectation of the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean is equal to the true mean. However, the maximum likelihood estimate for the covariance has an expectation that is less than the true value, and hence it is biased. We can correct this bias by de\ufb01ning a different estimator \u0004\u03a3 given by \u0004\u03a3 = 1 N \u22121 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5ML)(xn \u2212\u00b5ML)T.

(2.126) This result has a nice interpretation, as follows. After observing N \u22121 data points we have estimated \u00b5 by \u00b5(N\u22121) ML . We now observe data point xN, and we obtain our revised estimate \u00b5(N) ML by moving the old estimate a small amount, proportional to 1/N, in the direction of the \u2018error signal\u2019 (xN \u2212\u00b5(N\u22121) ML ). Note that, as N increases, so the contribution from successive data points gets smaller. The result (2.126) will clearly give the same answer as the batch result (2.121) because the two formulae are equivalent. However, we will not always be able to de- rive a sequential algorithm by this route, and so we seek a more general formulation of sequential learning, which leads us to the Robbins-Monro algorithm. Consider a pair of random variables \u03b8 and z governed by a joint distribution p(z, \u03b8). The con- ditional expectation of z given \u03b8 de\ufb01nes a deterministic function f(\u03b8) that is given by f(\u03b8) \u2261E[z|\u03b8] = \u0006 zp(z|\u03b8) dz (2.127) and is illustrated schematically in Figure 2.10. Functions de\ufb01ned in this way are called regression functions. Our goal is to \ufb01nd the root \u03b8\u22c6at which f(\u03b8\u22c6) = 0. If we had a large data set of observations of z and \u03b8, then we could model the regression function directly and then obtain an estimate of its root.

(2.132) It can then be shown (Robbins and Monro, 1951; Fukunaga, 1990) that the sequence of estimates given by (2.129) does indeed converge to the root with probability one. Note that the \ufb01rst condition (2.130) ensures that the successive corrections decrease in magnitude so that the process can converge to a limiting value. The second con- dition (2.131) is required to ensure that the algorithm does not converge short of the root, and the third condition (2.132) is needed to ensure that the accumulated noise has \ufb01nite variance and hence does not spoil convergence. Now let us consider how a general maximum likelihood problem can be solved sequentially using the Robbins-Monro algorithm. By de\ufb01nition, the maximum like- lihood solution \u03b8ML is a stationary point of the log likelihood function and hence satis\ufb01es \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 \u0018 1 N N \u0002 n=1 ln p(xn|\u03b8) \u0019\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \u03b8ML = 0. (2.133) Exchanging the derivative and the summation, and taking the limit N \u2192\u221ewe have lim N\u2192\u221e 1 N N \u0002 n=1 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 ln p(xn|\u03b8) = Ex \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 ln p(x|\u03b8) (2.134) and so we see that \ufb01nding the maximum likelihood solution corresponds to \ufb01nd- ing the root of a regression function. We can therefore apply the Robbins-Monro procedure, which now takes the form \u03b8(N) = \u03b8(N\u22121) + aN\u22121 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8(N\u22121) ln p(xN|\u03b8(N\u22121)). (2.135)",

The Gaussian Distribution 97 Figure 2.11 In the case of a Gaussian distribution, with \u03b8 corresponding to the mean \u00b5, the regression function illustrated in Figure 2.10 takes the form of a straight line, as shown in red. In this case, the random variable z corresponds to the derivative of the log likelihood function and is given by (x \u2212\u00b5ML)/\u03c32, and its expectation that de\ufb01nes the regression function is a straight line given by (\u00b5 \u2212\u00b5ML)/\u03c32. The root of the regres- sion function corresponds to the maximum like- lihood estimator \u00b5ML. \u00b5 z p(z|\u00b5) \u00b5ML As a speci\ufb01c example, we consider once again the sequential estimation of the mean of a Gaussian distribution, in which case the parameter \u03b8(N) is the estimate \u00b5(N) ML of the mean of the Gaussian, and the random variable z is given by z = \u2202 \u2202\u00b5ML ln p(x|\u00b5ML, \u03c32) = 1 \u03c32 (x \u2212\u00b5ML). (2.136) Thus the distribution of z is Gaussian with mean \u00b5 \u2212\u00b5ML, as illustrated in Fig- ure 2.11. Substituting (2.136) into (2.135), we obtain the univariate form of (2.126), provided we choose the coef\ufb01cients aN to have the form aN = \u03c32/N. Note that although we have focussed on the case of a single variable, the same technique, together with the same restrictions (2.130)\u2013(2.132) on the coef\ufb01cients aN, apply equally to the multivariate case (Blum, 1965). 2.3.6 Bayesian inference for the Gaussian The maximum likelihood framework gave point estimates for the parameters \u00b5 and \u03a3. Now we develop a Bayesian treatment by introducing prior distributions over these parameters. Let us begin with a simple example in which we consider a single Gaussian random variable x. We shall suppose that the variance \u03c32 is known, and we consider the task of inferring the mean \u00b5 given a set of N observations X = {x1, . . . , xN}. The likelihood function, that is the probability of the observed data given \u00b5, viewed as a function of \u00b5, is given by p(X|\u00b5) = N \u000e n=1 p(xn|\u00b5) = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c32)N/2 exp \u0018 \u22121 2\u03c32 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5)2 \u0019 . (2.137) Again we emphasize that the likelihood function p(X|\u00b5) is not a probability distri- bution over \u00b5 and is not normalized. We see that the likelihood function takes the form of the exponential of a quad- ratic form in \u00b5. Thus if we choose a prior p(\u00b5) given by a Gaussian, it will be a",

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS conjugate distribution for this likelihood function because the corresponding poste- rior will be a product of two exponentials of quadratic functions of \u00b5 and hence will also be Gaussian. We therefore take our prior distribution to be p(\u00b5) = N \u00b5|\u00b50, \u03c32 0 (2.138) and the posterior distribution is given by p(\u00b5|X) \u221dp(X|\u00b5)p(\u00b5). (2.139) Simple manipulation involving completing the square in the exponent shows that the Exercise 2.38 posterior distribution is given by p(\u00b5|X) = N \u00b5|\u00b5N, \u03c32 N (2.140) where \u00b5N = \u03c32 N\u03c32 0 + \u03c32 \u00b50 + N\u03c32 0 N\u03c32 0 + \u03c32 \u00b5ML (2.141) 1 \u03c32 N = 1 \u03c32 0 + N \u03c32 (2.142) in which \u00b5ML is the maximum likelihood solution for \u00b5 given by the sample mean \u00b5ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 xn. (2.143) It is worth spending a moment studying the form of the posterior mean and variance. First of all, we note that the mean of the posterior distribution given by (2.141) is a compromise between the prior mean \u00b50 and the maximum likelihood solution \u00b5ML. If the number of observed data points N = 0, then (2.141) reduces to the prior mean as expected. For N \u2192\u221e, the posterior mean is given by the maximum likelihood solution. Similarly, consider the result (2.142) for the variance of the posterior distribution. We see that this is most naturally expressed in terms of the inverse variance, which is called the precision. Furthermore, the precisions are additive, so that the precision of the posterior is given by the precision of the prior plus one contribution of the data precision from each of the observed data points. As we increase the number of observed data points, the precision steadily increases, corresponding to a posterior distribution with steadily decreasing variance. With no observed data points, we have the prior variance, whereas if the number of data points N \u2192\u221e, the variance \u03c32 N goes to zero and the posterior distribution becomes in\ufb01nitely peaked around the maximum likelihood solution. We therefore see that the maximum likelihood result of a point estimate for \u00b5 given by (2.143) is recovered precisely from the Bayesian formalism in the limit of an in\ufb01nite number of observations. Note also that for \ufb01nite N, if we take the limit \u03c32 0 \u2192\u221ein which the prior has in\ufb01nite variance then the posterior mean (2.141) reduces to the maximum likelihood result, while from (2.142) the posterior variance is given by \u03c32 N = \u03c32/N.",

The data points are generated from a Gaussian of mean 0.8 and variance 0.1, and the prior is chosen to have mean 0. In both the prior and the likelihood function, the variance is set to the true value. N = 0 N = 1 N = 2 N = 10 \u22121 0 1 0 5 We illustrate our analysis of Bayesian inference for the mean of a Gaussian distribution in Figure 2.12. The generalization of this result to the case of a D- dimensional Gaussian random variable x with known covariance and unknown mean is straightforward. Exercise 2.40 We have already seen how the maximum likelihood expression for the mean of a Gaussian can be re-cast as a sequential update formula in which the mean after Section 2.3.5 observing N data points was expressed in terms of the mean after observing N \u22121 data points together with the contribution from data point xN. In fact, the Bayesian paradigm leads very naturally to a sequential view of the inference problem. To see this in the context of the inference of the mean of a Gaussian, we write the posterior distribution with the contribution from the \ufb01nal data point xN separated out so that p(\u00b5|D) \u221d p(\u00b5) N\u22121 \u000e n=1 p(xn|\u00b5) p(xN|\u00b5). (2.144) The term in square brackets is (up to a normalization coef\ufb01cient) just the posterior distribution after observing N \u22121 data points. We see that this can be viewed as a prior distribution, which is combined using Bayes\u2019 theorem with the likelihood function associated with data point xN to arrive at the posterior distribution after observing N data points. This sequential view of Bayesian inference is very general and applies to any problem in which the observed data are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. So far, we have assumed that the variance of the Gaussian distribution over the data is known and our goal is to infer the mean. Now let us suppose that the mean is known and we wish to infer the variance. Again, our calculations will be greatly simpli\ufb01ed if we choose a conjugate form for the prior distribution. It turns out to be most convenient to work with the precision \u03bb \u22611/\u03c32. The likelihood function for \u03bb takes the form p(X|\u03bb) = N \u000e n=1 N(xn|\u00b5, \u03bb\u22121) \u221d\u03bbN/2 exp \u0018 \u2212\u03bb 2 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5)2 \u0019 . (2.145)",

    "text": "2.3. The Gaussian Distribution 101 From (2.150), we see that the effect of observing N data points is to increase the value of the coef\ufb01cient a by N/2. Thus we can interpret the parameter a0 in the prior in terms of 2a0 \u2018effective\u2019 prior observations. Similarly, from (2.151) we see that the N data points contribute N\u03c32 ML/2 to the parameter b, where \u03c32 ML is the variance, and so we can interpret the parameter b0 in the prior as arising from the 2a0 \u2018effective\u2019 prior observations having variance 2b0/(2a0) = b0/a0. Recall that we made an analogous interpretation for the Dirichlet prior. These distributions Section 2.2 are examples of the exponential family, and we shall see that the interpretation of a conjugate prior in terms of effective \ufb01ctitious data points is a general one for the exponential family of distributions. Instead of working with the precision, we can consider the variance itself. The conjugate prior in this case is called the inverse gamma distribution, although we shall not discuss this further because we will \ufb01nd it more convenient to work with the precision. Now suppose that both the mean and the precision are unknown. To \ufb01nd a conjugate prior, we consider the dependence of the likelihood function on \u00b5 and \u03bb p(X|\u00b5, \u03bb) = N \u000e n=1 \u000f \u03bb 2\u03c0 \u00101/2 exp \u2212\u03bb 2 (xn \u2212\u00b5)2 \u221d \u03bb1/2 exp \u000f \u2212\u03bb\u00b52 2 \u0010 N exp \u0018 \u03bb\u00b5 N \u0002 n=1 xn \u2212\u03bb 2 N \u0002 n=1 x2 n \u0019 . (2.152) We now wish to identify a prior distribution p(\u00b5, \u03bb) that has the same functional dependence on \u00b5 and \u03bb as the likelihood function and that should therefore take the form p(\u00b5, \u03bb) \u221d \u03bb1/2 exp \u000f \u2212\u03bb\u00b52 2 \u0010 \u03b2 exp {c\u03bb\u00b5 \u2212d\u03bb} = exp \u2212\u03b2\u03bb 2 (\u00b5 \u2212c/\u03b2)2 \u03bb\u03b2/2 exp \u2212 \u000f d \u2212c2 2\u03b2 \u0010 \u03bb (2.153) where c, d, and \u03b2 are constants. Since we can always write p(\u00b5, \u03bb) = p(\u00b5|\u03bb)p(\u03bb), we can \ufb01nd p(\u00b5|\u03bb) and p(\u03bb) by inspection. In particular, we see that p(\u00b5|\u03bb) is a Gaussian whose precision is a linear function of \u03bb and that p(\u03bb) is a gamma distri- bution, so that the normalized prior takes the form p(\u00b5, \u03bb) = N(\u00b5|\u00b50, (\u03b2\u03bb)\u22121)Gam(\u03bb|a, b) (2.154) where we have de\ufb01ned new constants given by \u00b50 = c/\u03b2, a = 1 + \u03b2/2, b = d\u2212c2/2\u03b2. The distribution (2.154) is called the normal-gamma or Gaussian-gamma distribution and is plotted in Figure 2.14. Note that this is not simply the product of an independent Gaussian prior over \u00b5 and a gamma prior over \u03bb, because the precision of \u00b5 is a linear function of \u03bb. Even if we chose a prior in which \u00b5 and \u03bb were independent, the posterior distribution would exhibit a coupling between the precision of \u00b5 and the value of \u03bb.",

The parameter \u03bb is sometimes called the precision of the t-distribution, even though it is not in general equal to the inverse of the variance. The parameter \u03bd is called the degrees of freedom, and its effect is illustrated in Figure 2.15. For the particular case of \u03bd = 1, the t-distribution reduces to the Cauchy distribution, while in the limit \u03bd \u2192\u221ethe t-distribution St(x|\u00b5, \u03bb, \u03bd) becomes a Gaussian N(x|\u00b5, \u03bb\u22121) with mean \u00b5 and precision \u03bb.

The result is a distribution that in gen- eral has longer \u2018tails\u2019 than a Gaussian, as was seen in Figure 2.15. This gives the t- distribution an important property called robustness, which means that it is much less sensitive than the Gaussian to the presence of a few data points which are outliers. The robustness of the t-distribution is illustrated in Figure 2.16, which compares the maximum likelihood solutions for a Gaussian and a t-distribution.

If we go back to (2.158) and substitute the alternative parameters \u03bd = 2a, \u03bb = a/b, and \u03b7 = \u03c4b/a, we see that the t-distribution can be written in the form St(x|\u00b5, \u03bb, \u03bd) = \u0006 \u221e 0 N x|\u00b5, (\u03b7\u03bb)\u22121 Gam(\u03b7|\u03bd/2, \u03bd/2) d\u03b7. (2.160) We can then generalize this to a multivariate Gaussian N(x|\u00b5, \u039b) to obtain the cor- responding multivariate Student\u2019s t-distribution in the form St(x|\u00b5, \u039b, \u03bd) = \u0006 \u221e 0 N(x|\u00b5, (\u03b7\u039b)\u22121)Gam(\u03b7|\u03bd/2, \u03bd/2) d\u03b7. (2.161) Using the same technique as for the univariate case, we can evaluate this integral to give Exercise 2.48",

One important case, which arises in practical applications, is that of periodic variables. An example of a periodic variable would be the wind direction at a particular geographical location. We might, for instance, measure values of wind direction on a number of days and wish to summarize this using a parametric distribution. Another example is calendar time, where we may be interested in modelling quantities that are believed to be periodic over 24 hours or over an annual cycle. Such quantities can conveniently be represented using an angular (polar) coordinate 0 \u2a7d\u03b8 < 2\u03c0. We might be tempted to treat periodic variables by choosing some direction as the origin and then applying a conventional distribution such as the Gaussian. Such an approach, however, would give results that were strongly dependent on the arbitrary choice of origin. Suppose, for instance, that we have two observations at \u03b81 = 1\u25e6and \u03b82 = 359\u25e6, and we model them using a standard univariate Gaussian distribution. If we choose the origin at 0\u25e6, then the sample mean of this data set will be 180\u25e6with standard deviation 179\u25e6, whereas if we choose the origin at 180\u25e6, then the mean will be 0\u25e6and the standard deviation will be 1\u25e6. We clearly need to develop a special approach for the treatment of periodic variables. Let us consider the problem of evaluating the mean of a set of observations D = {\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8N} of a periodic variable. From now on, we shall assume that \u03b8 is measured in radians. We have already seen that the simple average (\u03b81+\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03b8N)/N will be strongly coordinate dependent. To \ufb01nd an invariant measure of the mean, we note that the observations can be viewed as points on the unit circle and can therefore be described instead by two-dimensional unit vectors x1, . . . , xN where \u2225xn\u2225= 1 for n = 1, . . . , N, as illustrated in Figure 2.17. We can average the vectors {xn}",

Clearly, this de\ufb01nition will ensure that the location of the mean is independent of the origin of the angular coor- dinate. Note that x will typically lie inside the unit circle. The Cartesian coordinates of the observations are given by xn = (cos \u03b8n, sin \u03b8n), and we can write the Carte- sian coordinates of the sample mean in the form x = (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8). Substituting into (2.167) and equating the x1 and x2 components then gives r cos \u03b8 = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 cos \u03b8n, r sin \u03b8 = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 sin \u03b8n.

(2.169) Shortly, we shall see how this result arises naturally as the maximum likelihood estimator for an appropriately de\ufb01ned distribution over a periodic variable. We now consider a periodic generalization of the Gaussian called the von Mises distribution. Here we shall limit our attention to univariate distributions, although periodic distributions can also be found over hyperspheres of arbitrary dimension. For an extensive discussion of periodic distributions, see Mardia and Jupp (2000). By convention, we will consider distributions p(\u03b8) that have period 2\u03c0.

Thus p(\u03b8) must satisfy the three conditions p(\u03b8) \u2a7e 0 (2.170) \u0006 2\u03c0 0 p(\u03b8) d\u03b8 = 1 (2.171) p(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = p(\u03b8). (2.172) From (2.172), it follows that p(\u03b8 + M2\u03c0) = p(\u03b8) for any integer M. We can easily obtain a Gaussian-like distribution that satis\ufb01es these three prop- erties as follows. Consider a Gaussian distribution over two variables x = (x1, x2) having mean \u00b5 = (\u00b51, \u00b52) and a covariance matrix \u03a3 = \u03c32I where I is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix, so that p(x1, x2) = 1 2\u03c0\u03c32 exp \u2212(x1 \u2212\u00b51)2 + (x2 \u2212\u00b52)2 2\u03c32 . (2.173) The contours of constant p(x) are circles, as illustrated in Figure 2.18. Now suppose we consider the value of this distribution along a circle of \ufb01xed radius. Then by con- struction this distribution will be periodic, although it will not be normalized. We can determine the form of this distribution by transforming from Cartesian coordinates (x1, x2) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) so that x1 = r cos \u03b8, x2 = r sin \u03b8. (2.174) We also map the mean \u00b5 into polar coordinates by writing \u00b51 = r0 cos \u03b80, \u00b52 = r0 sin \u03b80. (2.175) Next we substitute these transformations into the two-dimensional Gaussian distribu- tion (2.173), and then condition on the unit circle r = 1, noting that we are interested only in the dependence on \u03b8.

For completeness, we mention brie\ufb02y some alternative techniques for the con- struction of periodic distributions. The simplest approach is to use a histogram of observations in which the angular coordinate is divided into \ufb01xed bins. This has the virtue of simplicity and \ufb02exibility but also suffers from signi\ufb01cant limitations, as we shall see when we discuss histogram methods in more detail in Section 2.5. Another approach starts, like the von Mises distribution, from a Gaussian distribution over a Euclidean space but now marginalizes onto the unit circle rather than conditioning (Mardia and Jupp, 2000). However, this leads to more complex forms of distribution and will not be discussed further. Finally, any valid distribution over the real axis (such as a Gaussian) can be turned into a periodic distribution by mapping succes- sive intervals of width 2\u03c0 onto the periodic variable (0, 2\u03c0), which corresponds to \u2018wrapping\u2019 the real axis around unit circle. Again, the resulting distribution is more complex to handle than the von Mises distribution. One limitation of the von Mises distribution is that it is unimodal. By forming mixtures of von Mises distributions, we obtain a \ufb02exible framework for modelling periodic variables that can handle multimodality. For an example of a machine learn- ing application that makes use of von Mises distributions, see Lawrence et al. (2002), and for extensions to modelling conditional densities for regression problems, see Bishop and Nabney (1996). 2.3.9 Mixtures of Gaussians While the Gaussian distribution has some important analytical properties, it suf- fers from signi\ufb01cant limitations when it comes to modelling real data sets. Consider the example shown in Figure 2.21.

We see that the data set forms two dominant clumps, and that a simple Gaussian distribution is unable to capture this structure, whereas a linear superposition of two Gaussians gives a better characterization of the data set. Such superpositions, formed by taking linear combinations of more basic dis- tributions such as Gaussians, can be formulated as probabilistic models known as mixture distributions (McLachlan and Basford, 1988; McLachlan and Peel, 2000). In Figure 2.22 we see that a linear combination of Gaussians can give rise to very complex densities. By using a suf\ufb01cient number of Gaussians, and by adjusting their means and covariances as well as the coef\ufb01cients in the linear combination, almost any continuous density can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy. We therefore consider a superposition of K Gaussian densities of the form p(x) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0kN(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) (2.188) which is called a mixture of Gaussians. Each Gaussian density N(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) is called a component of the mixture and has its own mean \u00b5k and covariance \u03a3k. Contour and surface plots for a Gaussian mixture having 3 components are shown in Figure 2.23. In this section we shall consider Gaussian components to illustrate the frame- work of mixture models. More generally, mixture models can comprise linear com- binations of other distributions. For instance, in Section 9.3.3 we shall consider mixtures of Bernoulli distributions as an example of a mixture model for discrete variables. Section 9.3.3 The parameters \u03c0k in (2.188) are called mixing coef\ufb01cients. If we integrate both sides of (2.188) with respect to x, and note that both p(x) and the individual Gaussian components are normalized, we obtain K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0k = 1. (2.189) Also, the requirement that p(x) \u2a7e0, together with N(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) \u2a7e0, implies \u03c0k \u2a7e0 for all k.

We immediately see that the situation is now much more complex than with a single Gaussian, due to the presence of the summation over k inside the logarithm. As a result, the maximum likelihood solution for the parameters no longer has a closed-form analytical solution. One approach to maxi- mizing the likelihood function is to use iterative numerical optimization techniques (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Alterna- tively we can employ a powerful framework called expectation maximization, which will be discussed at length in Chapter 9. 2.4. The Exponential Family The probability distributions that we have studied so far in this chapter (with the exception of the Gaussian mixture) are speci\ufb01c examples of a broad class of distri- butions called the exponential family (Duda and Hart, 1973; Bernardo and Smith, 1994). Members of the exponential family have many important properties in com- mon, and it is illuminating to discuss these properties in some generality. The exponential family of distributions over x, given parameters \u03b7, is de\ufb01ned to be the set of distributions of the form p(x|\u03b7) = h(x)g(\u03b7) exp \u001a \u03b7Tu(x)\u001b (2.194) where x may be scalar or vector, and may be discrete or continuous. Here \u03b7 are called the natural parameters of the distribution, and u(x) is some function of x. The function g(\u03b7) can be interpreted as the coef\ufb01cient that ensures that the distribu- tion is normalized and therefore satis\ufb01es g(\u03b7) \u0006 h(x) exp \u001a \u03b7Tu(x)\u001b dx = 1 (2.195) where the integration is replaced by summation if x is a discrete variable. We begin by taking some examples of the distributions introduced earlier in the chapter and showing that they are indeed members of the exponential family. Consider \ufb01rst the Bernoulli distribution p(x|\u00b5) = Bern(x|\u00b5) = \u00b5x(1 \u2212\u00b5)1\u2212x.

Again, we can write this in the standard representation (2.194) so that p(x|\u03b7) = exp(\u03b7Tx) (2.205) where \u03b7k = ln \u00b5k, and we have de\ufb01ned \u03b7 = (\u03b71, . . . , \u03b7M)T. Again, comparing with (2.194) we have u(x) = x (2.206) h(x) = 1 (2.207) g(\u03b7) = 1. (2.208) Note that the parameters \u03b7k are not independent because the parameters \u00b5k are sub- ject to the constraint M \u0002 k=1 \u00b5k = 1 (2.209) so that, given any M \u22121 of the parameters \u00b5k, the value of the remaining parameter is \ufb01xed. In some circumstances, it will be convenient to remove this constraint by expressing the distribution in terms of only M \u22121 parameters. This can be achieved by using the relationship (2.209) to eliminate \u00b5M by expressing it in terms of the remaining {\u00b5k} where k = 1, . . . , M \u22121, thereby leaving M \u22121 parameters. Note that these remaining parameters are still subject to the constraints 0 \u2a7d\u00b5k \u2a7d1, M\u22121 \u0002 k=1 \u00b5k \u2a7d1. (2.210)",

We see that the solution for the maximum likelihood estimator depends on the data only through \u0005 n u(xn), which is therefore called the suf\ufb01cient statistic of the distribution (2.194). We do not need to store the entire data set itself but only the value of the suf\ufb01cient statistic. For the Bernoulli distribution, for example, the function u(x) is given just by x and so we need only keep the sum of the data points {xn}, whereas for the Gaussian u(x) = (x, x2)T, and so we should keep both the sum of {xn} and the sum of {x2 n}. If we consider the limit N \u2192\u221e, then the right-hand side of (2.228) becomes E[u(x)], and so by comparing with (2.226) we see that in this limit \u03b7ML will equal the true value \u03b7. In fact, this suf\ufb01ciency property holds also for Bayesian inference, although we shall defer discussion of this until Chapter 8 when we have equipped ourselves with the tools of graphical models and can thereby gain a deeper insight into these important concepts. 2.4.2 Conjugate priors We have already encountered the concept of a conjugate prior several times, for example in the context of the Bernoulli distribution (for which the conjugate prior is the beta distribution) or the Gaussian (where the conjugate prior for the mean is a Gaussian, and the conjugate prior for the precision is the Wishart distribution). In general, for a given probability distribution p(x|\u03b7), we can seek a prior p(\u03b7) that is conjugate to the likelihood function, so that the posterior distribution has the same functional form as the prior. For any member of the exponential family (2.194), there exists a conjugate prior that can be written in the form p(\u03b7|\u03c7, \u03bd) = f(\u03c7, \u03bd)g(\u03b7)\u03bd exp \u001a \u03bd\u03b7T\u03c7 \u001b (2.229) where f(\u03c7, \u03bd) is a normalization coef\ufb01cient, and g(\u03b7) is the same function as ap- pears in (2.194). To see that this is indeed conjugate, let us multiply the prior (2.229) by the likelihood function (2.227) to obtain the posterior distribution, up to a nor- malization coef\ufb01cient, in the form p(\u03b7|X, \u03c7, \u03bd) \u221dg(\u03b7)\u03bd+N exp \u0018 \u03b7T \u0016 N \u0002 n=1 u(xn) + \u03bd\u03c7 \u0017\u0019 . (2.230) This again takes the same functional form as the prior (2.229), con\ufb01rming conjugacy. Furthermore, we see that the parameter \u03bd can be interpreted as a effective number of pseudo-observations in the prior, each of which has a value for the suf\ufb01cient statistic u(x) given by \u03c7. 2.4.3 Noninformative priors In some applications of probabilistic inference, we may have prior knowledge that can be conveniently expressed through the prior distribution. For example, if the prior assigns zero probability to some value of variable, then the posterior dis- tribution will necessarily also assign zero probability to that value, irrespective of",

    "text": "118 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS any subsequent observations of data. In many cases, however, we may have little idea of what form the distribution should take. We may then seek a form of prior distribution, called a noninformative prior, which is intended to have as little in\ufb02u- ence on the posterior distribution as possible (Jeffries, 1946; Box and Tao, 1973; Bernardo and Smith, 1994). This is sometimes referred to as \u2018letting the data speak for themselves\u2019. If we have a distribution p(x|\u03bb) governed by a parameter \u03bb, we might be tempted to propose a prior distribution p(\u03bb) = const as a suitable prior. If \u03bb is a discrete variable with K states, this simply amounts to setting the prior probability of each state to 1/K. In the case of continuous parameters, however, there are two potential dif\ufb01culties with this approach. The \ufb01rst is that, if the domain of \u03bb is unbounded, this prior distribution cannot be correctly normalized because the integral over \u03bb diverges. Such priors are called improper. In practice, improper priors can often be used provided the corresponding posterior distribution is proper, i.e., that it can be correctly normalized. For instance, if we put a uniform prior distribution over the mean of a Gaussian, then the posterior distribution for the mean, once we have observed at least one data point, will be proper. A second dif\ufb01culty arises from the transformation behaviour of a probability density under a nonlinear change of variables, given by (1.27). If a function h(\u03bb) is constant, and we change variables to \u03bb = \u03b72, then \u0001h(\u03b7) = h(\u03b72) will also be constant. However, if we choose the density p\u03bb(\u03bb) to be constant, then the density of \u03b7 will be given, from (1.27), by p\u03b7(\u03b7) = p\u03bb(\u03bb) \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 d\u03bb d\u03b7 \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 = p\u03bb(\u03b72)2\u03b7 \u221d\u03b7 (2.231) and so the density over \u03b7 will not be constant. This issue does not arise when we use maximum likelihood, because the likelihood function p(x|\u03bb) is a simple function of \u03bb and so we are free to use any convenient parameterization. If, however, we are to choose a prior distribution that is constant, we must take care to use an appropriate representation for the parameters. Here we consider two simple examples of noninformative priors (Berger, 1985). First of all, if a density takes the form p(x|\u00b5) = f(x \u2212\u00b5) (2.232) then the parameter \u00b5 is known as a location parameter. This family of densities exhibits translation invariance because if we shift x by a constant to give \u0001x = x + c, then p(\u0001x|\u0001\u00b5) = f(\u0001x \u2212\u0001\u00b5) (2.233) where we have de\ufb01ned \u0001\u00b5 = \u00b5 + c. Thus the density takes the same form in the new variable as in the original one, and so the density is independent of the choice of origin. We would like to choose a prior distribution that re\ufb02ects this translation invariance property, and so we choose a prior that assigns equal probability mass to",

This implies \u0006 B A p(\u00b5) d\u00b5 = \u0006 B\u2212c A\u2212c p(\u00b5) d\u00b5 = \u0006 B A p(\u00b5 \u2212c) d\u00b5 (2.234) and because this must hold for all choices of A and B, we have p(\u00b5 \u2212c) = p(\u00b5) (2.235) which implies that p(\u00b5) is constant. An example of a location parameter would be the mean \u00b5 of a Gaussian distribution. As we have seen, the conjugate prior distri- bution for \u00b5 in this case is a Gaussian p(\u00b5|\u00b50, \u03c32 0) = N(\u00b5|\u00b50, \u03c32 0), and we obtain a noninformative prior by taking the limit \u03c32 0 \u2192\u221e. Indeed, from (2.141) and (2.142) we see that this gives a posterior distribution over \u00b5 in which the contributions from the prior vanish. As a second example, consider a density of the form p(x|\u03c3) = 1 \u03c3 f \u0011x \u03c3 \u0012 (2.236) where \u03c3 > 0. Note that this will be a normalized density provided f(x) is correctly normalized. The parameter \u03c3 is known as a scale parameter, and the density exhibits Exercise 2.59 scale invariance because if we scale x by a constant to give \u0001x = cx, then p(\u0001x|\u0001\u03c3) = 1 \u0001\u03c3 f \u000f\u0001x \u0001\u03c3 \u0010 (2.237) where we have de\ufb01ned \u0001\u03c3 = c\u03c3. This transformation corresponds to a change of scale, for example from meters to kilometers if x is a length, and we would like to choose a prior distribution that re\ufb02ects this scale invariance. If we consider an interval A \u2a7d\u03c3 \u2a7dB, and a scaled interval A/c \u2a7d\u03c3 \u2a7dB/c, then the prior should assign equal probability mass to these two intervals. Thus we have \u0006 B A p(\u03c3) d\u03c3 = \u0006 B/c A/c p(\u03c3) d\u03c3 = \u0006 B A p \u000f1 c\u03c3 \u0010 1 c d\u03c3 (2.238) and because this must hold for choices of A and B, we have p(\u03c3) = p \u000f1 c\u03c3 \u0010 1 c (2.239) and hence p(\u03c3) \u221d1/\u03c3. Note that again this is an improper prior because the integral of the distribution over 0 \u2a7d\u03c3 \u2a7d\u221eis divergent. It is sometimes also convenient to think of the prior distribution for a scale parameter in terms of the density of the log of the parameter. Using the transformation rule (1.27) for densities we see that p(ln \u03c3) = const. Thus, for this prior there is the same probability mass in the range 1 \u2a7d\u03c3 \u2a7d10 as in the range 10 \u2a7d\u03c3 \u2a7d100 and in 100 \u2a7d\u03c3 \u2a7d1000.",

As discussed earlier, it is often more convenient to work in terms of the precision \u03bb = 1/\u03c32 rather than \u03c3 itself. Using the transformation rule for densities, we see that a distribution p(\u03c3) \u221d1/\u03c3 corresponds to a distribution over \u03bb of the form p(\u03bb) \u221d1/\u03bb. We have seen that the conjugate prior for \u03bb was the gamma distribution Gam(\u03bb|a0, b0) given by (2.146). The noninformative prior is obtained Section 2.3 as the special case a0 = b0 = 0. Again, if we examine the results (2.150) and (2.151) for the posterior distribution of \u03bb, we see that for a0 = b0 = 0, the posterior depends only on terms arising from the data and not from the prior. 2.5. Nonparametric Methods Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on the use of probability distributions having speci\ufb01c functional forms governed by a small number of parameters whose values are to be determined from a data set. This is called the parametric approach to density modelling. An important limitation of this approach is that the chosen density might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can result in poor predictive performance. For instance, if the process that generates the data is multimodal, then this aspect of the distribution can never be captured by a Gaussian, which is necessarily unimodal. In this \ufb01nal section, we consider some nonparametric approaches to density es- timation that make few assumptions about the form of the distribution. Here we shall focus mainly on simple frequentist methods. The reader should be aware, however, that nonparametric Bayesian methods are attracting increasing interest (Walker et al., 1999; Neal, 2000; M\u00a8uller and Quintana, 2004; Teh et al., 2006). Let us start with a discussion of histogram methods for density estimation, which we have already encountered in the context of marginal and conditional distributions in Figure 1.11 and in the context of the central limit theorem in Figure 2.6. Here we explore the properties of histogram density models in more detail, focussing on the case of a single continuous variable x. Standard histograms simply partition x into distinct bins of width \u2206i and then count the number ni of observations of x falling in bin i. In order to turn this count into a normalized probability density, we simply divide by the total number N of observations and by the width \u2206i of the bins to obtain probability values for each bin given by pi = ni N\u2206i (2.241) for which it is easily seen that p(x) dx = 1. This gives a model for the density p(x) that is constant over the width of each bin, and often the bins are chosen to have the same width \u2206i = \u2206.",

Here the data is drawn from the distribution, corresponding to the green curve, which is formed from a mixture of two Gaussians. Also shown are three examples of his- togram density estimates corresponding to three different choices for the bin width \u2206. We see that when \u2206is very small (top \ufb01gure), the resulting density model is very spiky, with a lot of structure that is not present in the underlying distribution that generated the data set. Conversely, if \u2206is too large (bottom \ufb01gure) then the result is a model that is too smooth and that consequently fails to capture the bimodal prop- erty of the green curve. The best results are obtained for some intermediate value of \u2206(middle \ufb01gure). In principle, a histogram density model is also dependent on the choice of edge location for the bins, though this is typically much less signi\ufb01cant than the value of \u2206. Note that the histogram method has the property (unlike the methods to be dis- cussed shortly) that, once the histogram has been computed, the data set itself can be discarded, which can be advantageous if the data set is large. Also, the histogram approach is easily applied if the data points are arriving sequentially. In practice, the histogram technique can be useful for obtaining a quick visual- ization of data in one or two dimensions but is unsuited to most density estimation applications. One obvious problem is that the estimated density has discontinuities that are due to the bin edges rather than any property of the underlying distribution that generated the data. Another major limitation of the histogram approach is its scaling with dimensionality. If we divide each variable in a D-dimensional space into M bins, then the total number of bins will be M D. This exponential scaling with D is an example of the curse of dimensionality. In a space of high dimensional- Section 1.4 ity, the quantity of data needed to provide meaningful estimates of local probability density would be prohibitive. The histogram approach to density estimation does, however, teach us two im- portant lessons. First, to estimate the probability density at a particular location, we should consider the data points that lie within some local neighbourhood of that point. Note that the concept of locality requires that we assume some form of dis- tance measure, and here we have been assuming Euclidean distance. For histograms,",

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS this neighbourhood property was de\ufb01ned by the bins, and there is a natural \u2018smooth- ing\u2019 parameter describing the spatial extent of the local region, in this case the bin width. Second, the value of the smoothing parameter should be neither too large nor too small in order to obtain good results. This is reminiscent of the choice of model complexity in polynomial curve \ufb01tting discussed in Chapter 1 where the degree M of the polynomial, or alternatively the value \u03b1 of the regularization parameter, was optimal for some intermediate value, neither too large nor too small. Armed with these insights, we turn now to a discussion of two widely used nonparametric tech- niques for density estimation, kernel estimators and nearest neighbours, which have better scaling with dimensionality than the simple histogram model. 2.5.1 Kernel density estimators Let us suppose that observations are being drawn from some unknown probabil- ity density p(x) in some D-dimensional space, which we shall take to be Euclidean, and we wish to estimate the value of p(x). From our earlier discussion of locality, let us consider some small region R containing x. The probability mass associated with this region is given by P = \u0006 R p(x) dx. (2.242) Now suppose that we have collected a data set comprising N observations drawn from p(x). Because each data point has a probability P of falling within R, the total number K of points that lie inside R will be distributed according to the binomial distribution Section 2.1 Bin(K|N, P) = N! K!(N \u2212K)!P K(1 \u2212P)1\u2212K. (2.243) Using (2.11), we see that the mean fraction of points falling inside the region is E[K/N] = P, and similarly using (2.12) we see that the variance around this mean is var[K/N] = P(1 \u2212P)/N. For large N, this distribution will be sharply peaked around the mean and so K \u2243NP. (2.244) If, however, we also assume that the region R is suf\ufb01ciently small that the probability density p(x) is roughly constant over the region, then we have P \u2243p(x)V (2.245) where V is the volume of R. Combining (2.244) and (2.245), we obtain our density estimate in the form p(x) = K NV . (2.246) Note that the validity of (2.246) depends on two contradictory assumptions, namely that the region R be suf\ufb01ciently small that the density is approximately constant over the region and yet suf\ufb01ciently large (in relation to the value of that density) that the number K of points falling inside the region is suf\ufb01cient for the binomial distribution to be sharply peaked.",

Either we can \ufb01x K and determine the value of V from the data, which gives rise to the K-nearest-neighbour technique discussed shortly, or we can \ufb01x V and determine K from the data, giv- ing rise to the kernel approach. It can be shown that both the K-nearest-neighbour density estimator and the kernel density estimator converge to the true probability density in the limit N \u2192\u221eprovided V shrinks suitably with N, and K grows with N (Duda and Hart, 1973). We begin by discussing the kernel method in detail, and to start with we take the region R to be a small hypercube centred on the point x at which we wish to determine the probability density. In order to count the number K of points falling within this region, it is convenient to de\ufb01ne the following function k(u) = 1, |ui| \u2a7d1/2, i = 1, . . . , D, 0, otherwise (2.247) which represents a unit cube centred on the origin. The function k(u) is an example of a kernel function, and in this context is also called a Parzen window. From (2.247), the quantity k((x \u2212xn)/h) will be one if the data point xn lies inside a cube of side h centred on x, and zero otherwise. The total number of data points lying inside this cube will therefore be K = N \u0002 n=1 k \u0011x \u2212xn h \u0012 . (2.248) Substituting this expression into (2.246) then gives the following result for the esti- mated density at x p(x) = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 1 hD k \u0011x \u2212xn h \u0012 (2.249) where we have used V = hD for the volume of a hypercube of side h in D di- mensions. Using the symmetry of the function k(u), we can now re-interpret this equation, not as a single cube centred on x but as the sum over N cubes centred on the N data points xn. As it stands, the kernel density estimator (2.249) will suffer from one of the same problems that the histogram method suffered from, namely the presence of arti\ufb01cial discontinuities, in this case at the boundaries of the cubes. We can obtain a smoother density model if we choose a smoother kernel function, and a common choice is the Gaussian, which gives rise to the following kernel density model p(x) = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 1 (2\u03c0h2)1/2 exp \u2212\u2225x \u2212xn\u22252 2h2 (2.250) where h represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian components. Thus our density model is obtained by placing a Gaussian over each data point and then adding up the contributions over the whole data set, and then dividing by N so that the den- sity is correctly normalized. In Figure 2.25, we apply the model (2.250) to the data",

The best den- sity model is obtained for some intermedi- ate value of h (middle panel). h = 0.005 0 0.5 1 0 5 h = 0.07 0 0.5 1 0 5 h = 0.2 0 0.5 1 0 5 set used earlier to demonstrate the histogram technique. We see that, as expected, the parameter h plays the role of a smoothing parameter, and there is a trade-off between sensitivity to noise at small h and over-smoothing at large h. Again, the optimization of h is a problem in model complexity, analogous to the choice of bin width in histogram density estimation, or the degree of the polynomial used in curve \ufb01tting. We can choose any other kernel function k(u) in (2.249) subject to the condi- tions k(u) \u2a7e 0, (2.251) \u0006 k(u) du = 1 (2.252) which ensure that the resulting probability distribution is nonnegative everywhere and integrates to one. The class of density model given by (2.249) is called a kernel density estimator, or Parzen estimator. It has a great merit that there is no compu- tation involved in the \u2018training\u2019 phase because this simply requires storage of the training set. However, this is also one of its great weaknesses because the computa- tional cost of evaluating the density grows linearly with the size of the data set. 2.5.2 Nearest-neighbour methods One of the dif\ufb01culties with the kernel approach to density estimation is that the parameter h governing the kernel width is \ufb01xed for all kernels. In regions of high data density, a large value of h may lead to over-smoothing and a washing out of structure that might otherwise be extracted from the data. However, reducing h may lead to noisy estimates elsewhere in data space where the density is smaller. Thus the optimal choice for h may be dependent on location within the data space. This issue is addressed by nearest-neighbour methods for density estimation. We therefore return to our general result (2.246) for local density estimation, and instead of \ufb01xing V and determining the value of K from the data, we consider a \ufb01xed value of K and use the data to \ufb01nd an appropriate value for V . To do this, we consider a small sphere centred on the point x at which we wish to estimate the",

The estimate of the density p(x) is then given by (2.246) with V set to the volume of the resulting sphere. This technique is known as K nearest neighbours and is illustrated in Figure 2.26, for various choices of the parameter K, using the same data set as used in Figure 2.24 and Figure 2.25. We see that the value of K now governs the degree of smoothing and that again there is an optimum choice for K that is neither too large nor too small. Note that the model produced by K nearest neighbours is not a true density model because the integral over all space diverges. Exercise 2.61 We close this chapter by showing how the K-nearest-neighbour technique for density estimation can be extended to the problem of classi\ufb01cation. To do this, we apply the K-nearest-neighbour density estimation technique to each class separately and then make use of Bayes\u2019 theorem. Let us suppose that we have a data set com- prising Nk points in class Ck with N points in total, so that \u0005 k Nk = N. If we wish to classify a new point x, we draw a sphere centred on x containing precisely K points irrespective of their class. Suppose this sphere has volume V and contains Kk points from class Ck. Then (2.246) provides an estimate of the density associated with each class p(x|Ck) = Kk NkV . (2.253) Similarly, the unconditional density is given by p(x) = K NV (2.254) while the class priors are given by p(Ck) = Nk N . (2.255) We can now combine (2.253), (2.254), and (2.255) using Bayes\u2019 theorem to obtain the posterior probability of class membership p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) = Kk K . (2.256)",

Ties can be broken at random. The particular case of K = 1 is called the nearest-neighbour rule, because a test point is simply assigned to the same class as the nearest point from the training set.

As discussed so far, both the K-nearest-neighbour method, and the kernel den- sity estimator, require the entire training data set to be stored, leading to expensive computation if the data set is large. This effect can be offset, at the expense of some additional one-off computation, by constructing tree-based search structures to allow (approximate) near neighbours to be found ef\ufb01ciently without doing an exhaustive search of the data set. Nevertheless, these nonparametric methods are still severely limited. On the other hand, we have seen that simple parametric models are very restricted in terms of the forms of distribution that they can represent. We therefore need to \ufb01nd density models that are very \ufb02exible and yet for which the complexity of the models can be controlled independently of the size of the training set, and we shall see in subsequent chapters how to achieve this.

    "text": "3 Linear Models for Regression The focus so far in this book has been on unsupervised learning, including topics such as density estimation and data clustering. We turn now to a discussion of super- vised learning, starting with regression. The goal of regression is to predict the value of one or more continuous target variables t given the value of a D-dimensional vec- tor x of input variables. We have already encountered an example of a regression problem when we considered polynomial curve \ufb01tting in Chapter 1. The polynomial is a speci\ufb01c example of a broad class of functions called linear regression models, which share the property of being linear functions of the adjustable parameters, and which will form the focus of this chapter. The simplest form of linear regression models are also linear functions of the input variables. However, we can obtain a much more useful class of functions by taking linear combinations of a \ufb01xed set of nonlinear functions of the input variables, known as basis functions. Such models are linear functions of the parameters, which gives them simple analytical properties, and yet can be nonlinear with respect to the input variables. 137",

    "text": "138 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION Given a training data set comprising N observations {xn}, where n = 1, . . . , N, together with corresponding target values {tn}, the goal is to predict the value of t for a new value of x. In the simplest approach, this can be done by directly con- structing an appropriate function y(x) whose values for new inputs x constitute the predictions for the corresponding values of t. More generally, from a probabilistic perspective, we aim to model the predictive distribution p(t|x) because this expresses our uncertainty about the value of t for each value of x. From this conditional dis- tribution we can make predictions of t, for any new value of x, in such a way as to minimize the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. As discussed in Sec- tion 1.5.5, a common choice of loss function for real-valued variables is the squared loss, for which the optimal solution is given by the conditional expectation of t. Although linear models have signi\ufb01cant limitations as practical techniques for pattern recognition, particularly for problems involving input spaces of high dimen- sionality, they have nice analytical properties and form the foundation for more so- phisticated models to be discussed in later chapters. 3.1. Linear Basis Function Models The simplest linear model for regression is one that involves a linear combination of the input variables y(x, w) = w0 + w1x1 + . . . + wDxD (3.1) where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T. This is often simply known as linear regression. The key property of this model is that it is a linear function of the parameters w0, . . . , wD. It is also, however, a linear function of the input variables xi, and this imposes signi\ufb01cant limitations on the model. We therefore extend the class of models by considering linear combinations of \ufb01xed nonlinear functions of the input variables, of the form y(x, w) = w0 + M\u22121 \u0002 j=1 wj\u03c6j(x) (3.2) where \u03c6j(x) are known as basis functions. By denoting the maximum value of the index j by M \u22121, the total number of parameters in this model will be M. The parameter w0 allows for any \ufb01xed offset in the data and is sometimes called a bias parameter (not to be confused with \u2018bias\u2019 in a statistical sense). It is often convenient to de\ufb01ne an additional dummy \u2018basis function\u2019 \u03c60(x) = 1 so that y(x, w) = M\u22121 \u0002 j=0 wj\u03c6j(x) = wT\u03c6(x) (3.3) where w = (w0, . . . , wM\u22121)T and \u03c6 = (\u03c60, . . . , \u03c6M\u22121)T.

If the original variables com- prise the vector x, then the features can be expressed in terms of the basis functions {\u03c6j(x)}. By using nonlinear basis functions, we allow the function y(x, w) to be a non- linear function of the input vector x. Functions of the form (3.2) are called linear models, however, because this function is linear in w. It is this linearity in the pa- rameters that will greatly simplify the analysis of this class of models. However, it also leads to some signi\ufb01cant limitations, as we discuss in Section 3.6. The example of polynomial regression considered in Chapter 1 is a particular example of this model in which there is a single input variable x, and the basis func- tions take the form of powers of x so that \u03c6j(x) = xj. One limitation of polynomial basis functions is that they are global functions of the input variable, so that changes in one region of input space affect all other regions. This can be resolved by dividing the input space up into regions and \ufb01t a different polynomial in each region, leading to spline functions (Hastie et al., 2001). There are many other possible choices for the basis functions, for example \u03c6j(x) = exp \u2212(x \u2212\u00b5j)2 2s2 (3.4) where the \u00b5j govern the locations of the basis functions in input space, and the pa- rameter s governs their spatial scale. These are usually referred to as \u2018Gaussian\u2019 basis functions, although it should be noted that they are not required to have a prob- abilistic interpretation, and in particular the normalization coef\ufb01cient is unimportant because these basis functions will be multiplied by adaptive parameters wj. Another possibility is the sigmoidal basis function of the form \u03c6j(x) = \u03c3 \u0011x \u2212\u00b5j s \u0012 (3.5) where \u03c3(a) is the logistic sigmoid function de\ufb01ned by \u03c3(a) = 1 1 + exp(\u2212a). (3.6) Equivalently, we can use the \u2018tanh\u2019 function because this is related to the logistic sigmoid by tanh(a) = 2\u03c3(a) \u22121, and so a general linear combination of logistic sigmoid functions is equivalent to a general linear combination of \u2018tanh\u2019 functions. These various choices of basis function are illustrated in Figure 3.1. Yet another possible choice of basis function is the Fourier basis, which leads to an expansion in sinusoidal functions. Each basis function represents a speci\ufb01c fre- quency and has in\ufb01nite spatial extent. By contrast, basis functions that are localized to \ufb01nite regions of input space necessarily comprise a spectrum of different spatial frequencies. In many signal processing applications, it is of interest to consider ba- sis functions that are localized in both space and frequency, leading to a class of functions known as wavelets. These are also de\ufb01ned to be mutually orthogonal, to simplify their application. Wavelets are most applicable when the input values live",

Useful texts on wavelets include Ogden (1997), Mallat (1999), and Vidakovic (1999). Most of the discussion in this chapter, however, is independent of the particular choice of basis function set, and so for most of our discussion we shall not specify the particular form of the basis functions, except for the purposes of numerical il- lustration. Indeed, much of our discussion will be equally applicable to the situation in which the vector \u03c6(x) of basis functions is simply the identity \u03c6(x) = x. Fur- thermore, in order to keep the notation simple, we shall focus on the case of a single target variable t.

We also showed that this error function could be motivated as the maximum likelihood solution under an assumed Gaussian noise model. Let us return to this discussion and consider the least squares approach, and its relation to maximum likelihood, in more detail. As before, we assume that the target variable t is given by a deterministic func- tion y(x, w) with additive Gaussian noise so that t = y(x, w) + \u03f5 (3.7) where \u03f5 is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with precision (inverse variance) \u03b2. Thus we can write p(t|x, w, \u03b2) = N(t|y(x, w), \u03b2\u22121). (3.8) Recall that, if we assume a squared loss function, then the optimal prediction, for a new value of x, will be given by the conditional mean of the target variable. In the Section 1.5.5 case of a Gaussian conditional distribution of the form (3.8), the conditional mean",

(3.9) Note that the Gaussian noise assumption implies that the conditional distribution of t given x is unimodal, which may be inappropriate for some applications. An ex- tension to mixtures of conditional Gaussian distributions, which permit multimodal conditional distributions, will be discussed in Section 14.5.1. Now consider a data set of inputs X = {x1, . . . , xN} with corresponding target values t1, . . . , tN. We group the target variables {tn} into a column vector that we denote by t where the typeface is chosen to distinguish it from a single observation of a multivariate target, which would be denoted t. Making the assumption that these data points are drawn independently from the distribution (3.8), we obtain the following expression for the likelihood function, which is a function of the adjustable parameters w and \u03b2, in the form p(t|X, w, \u03b2) = N \u000e n=1 N(tn|wT\u03c6(xn), \u03b2\u22121) (3.10) where we have used (3.3). Note that in supervised learning problems such as regres- sion (and classi\ufb01cation), we are not seeking to model the distribution of the input variables. Thus x will always appear in the set of conditioning variables, and so from now on we will drop the explicit x from expressions such as p(t|x, w, \u03b2) in or- der to keep the notation uncluttered. Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function, and making use of the standard form (1.46) for the univariate Gaussian, we have ln p(t|w, \u03b2) = N \u0002 n=1 ln N(tn|wT\u03c6(xn), \u03b2\u22121) = N 2 ln \u03b2 \u2212N 2 ln(2\u03c0) \u2212\u03b2ED(w) (3.11) where the sum-of-squares error function is de\ufb01ned by ED(w) = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {tn \u2212wT\u03c6(xn)}2.

(3.16) The quantity \u03a6\u2020 \u2261 \u03a6T\u03a6 \u22121 \u03a6T (3.17) is known as the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the matrix \u03a6 (Rao and Mitra, 1971; Golub and Van Loan, 1996). It can be regarded as a generalization of the notion of matrix inverse to nonsquare matrices. Indeed, if \u03a6 is square and invertible, then using the property (AB)\u22121 = B\u22121A\u22121 we see that \u03a6\u2020 \u2261\u03a6\u22121.

(3.20) Thus the bias w0 compensates for the difference between the averages (over the training set) of the target values and the weighted sum of the averages of the basis function values. We can also maximize the log likelihood function (3.11) with respect to the noise precision parameter \u03b2, giving 1 \u03b2ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 {tn \u2212wT ML\u03c6(xn)}2 (3.21)",

The least-squares regression function is obtained by \ufb01nding the or- thogonal projection of the data vector t onto the subspace spanned by the basis functions \u03c6j(x) in which each basis function is viewed as a vec- tor \u03d5j of length N with elements \u03c6j(xn). S t y \u03d51 \u03d52 and so we see that the inverse of the noise precision is given by the residual variance of the target values around the regression function. 3.1.2 Geometry of least squares At this point, it is instructive to consider the geometrical interpretation of the least-squares solution. To do this we consider an N-dimensional space whose axes are given by the tn, so that t = (t1, . . . , tN)T is a vector in this space. Each basis function \u03c6j(xn), evaluated at the N data points, can also be represented as a vector in the same space, denoted by \u03d5j, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Note that \u03d5j corresponds to the jth column of \u03a6, whereas \u03c6(xn) corresponds to the nth row of \u03a6. If the number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points, then the M vectors \u03c6j(xn) will span a linear subspace S of dimensionality M. We de\ufb01ne y to be an N-dimensional vector whose nth element is given by y(xn, w), where n = 1, . . . , N. Because y is an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors \u03d5j, it can live anywhere in the M-dimensional subspace. The sum-of-squares error (3.12) is then equal (up to a factor of 1/2) to the squared Euclidean distance between y and t. Thus the least-squares solution for w corresponds to that choice of y that lies in subspace S and that is closest to t. Intuitively, from Figure 3.2, we anticipate that this solution corresponds to the orthogonal projection of t onto the subspace S. This is indeed the case, as can easily be veri\ufb01ed by noting that the solution for y is given by \u03a6wML, and then con\ufb01rming that this takes the form of an orthogonal projection. Exercise 3.2 In practice, a direct solution of the normal equations can lead to numerical dif\ufb01- culties when \u03a6T\u03a6 is close to singular. In particular, when two or more of the basis vectors \u03d5j are co-linear, or nearly so, the resulting parameter values can have large magnitudes. Such near degeneracies will not be uncommon when dealing with real data sets. The resulting numerical dif\ufb01culties can be addressed using the technique of singular value decomposition, or SVD (Press et al., 1992; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Note that the addition of a regularization term ensures that the matrix is non- singular, even in the presence of degeneracies. 3.1.3 Sequential learning Batch techniques, such as the maximum likelihood solution (3.15), which in- volve processing the entire training set in one go, can be computationally costly for large data sets. As we have discussed in Chapter 1, if the data set is suf\ufb01ciently large, it may be worthwhile to use sequential algorithms, also known as on-line algorithms,",

Sequential learning is also appropriate for real- time applications in which the data observations are arriving in a continuous stream, and predictions must be made before all of the data points are seen. We can obtain a sequential learning algorithm by applying the technique of stochastic gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent, as follows. If the error function comprises a sum over data points E = \u0005 n En, then after presen- tation of pattern n, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the parameter vector w using w(\u03c4+1) = w(\u03c4) \u2212\u03b7\u2207En (3.22) where \u03c4 denotes the iteration number, and \u03b7 is a learning rate parameter. We shall discuss the choice of value for \u03b7 shortly. The value of w is initialized to some starting vector w(0). For the case of the sum-of-squares error function (3.12), this gives w(\u03c4+1) = w(\u03c4) + \u03b7(tn \u2212w(\u03c4)T\u03c6n)\u03c6n (3.23) where \u03c6n = \u03c6(xn). This is known as least-mean-squares or the LMS algorithm. The value of \u03b7 needs to be chosen with care to ensure that the algorithm converges (Bishop and Nabney, 2008). 3.1.4 Regularized least squares In Section 1.1, we introduced the idea of adding a regularization term to an error function in order to control over-\ufb01tting, so that the total error function to be minimized takes the form ED(w) + \u03bbEW (w) (3.24) where \u03bb is the regularization coef\ufb01cient that controls the relative importance of the data-dependent error ED(w) and the regularization term EW (w). One of the sim- plest forms of regularizer is given by the sum-of-squares of the weight vector ele- ments EW (w) = 1 2wTw. (3.25) If we also consider the sum-of-squares error function given by E(w) = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {tn \u2212wT\u03c6(xn)}2 (3.26) then the total error function becomes 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {tn \u2212wT\u03c6(xn)}2 + \u03bb 2 wTw. (3.27) This particular choice of regularizer is known in the machine learning literature as weight decay because in sequential learning algorithms, it encourages weight values to decay towards zero, unless supported by the data. In statistics, it provides an ex- ample of a parameter shrinkage method because it shrinks parameter values towards",

It has the advantage that the error function remains a quadratic function of w, and so its exact minimizer can be found in closed form. Speci\ufb01cally, setting the gradient of (3.27) with respect to w to zero, and solving for w as before, we obtain w = \u03bbI + \u03a6T\u03a6 \u22121 \u03a6Tt. (3.28) This represents a simple extension of the least-squares solution (3.15). A more general regularizer is sometimes used, for which the regularized error takes the form 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {tn \u2212wT\u03c6(xn)}2 + \u03bb 2 M \u0002 j=1 |wj|q (3.29) where q = 2 corresponds to the quadratic regularizer (3.27). Figure 3.3 shows con- tours of the regularization function for different values of q. The case of q = 1 is know as the lasso in the statistics literature (Tibshirani, 1996). It has the property that if \u03bb is suf\ufb01ciently large, some of the coef\ufb01cients wj are driven to zero, leading to a sparse model in which the corresponding basis functions play no role. To see this, we \ufb01rst note that minimizing (3.29) is equivalent to minimizing the unregularized sum-of-squares error (3.12) subject to the constraint Exercise 3.5 M \u0002 j=1 |wj|q \u2a7d\u03b7 (3.30) for an appropriate value of the parameter \u03b7, where the two approaches can be related using Lagrange multipliers. The origin of the sparsity can be seen from Figure 3.4, Appendix E which shows that the minimum of the error function, subject to the constraint (3.30). As \u03bb is increased, so an increasing number of parameters are driven to zero. Regularization allows complex models to be trained on data sets of limited size without severe over-\ufb01tting, essentially by limiting the effective model complexity. However, the problem of determining the optimal model complexity is then shifted from one of \ufb01nding the appropriate number of basis functions to one of determining a suitable value of the regularization coef\ufb01cient \u03bb.

In some applica- tions, we may wish to predict K > 1 target variables, which we denote collectively by the target vector t. This could be done by introducing a different set of basis func- tions for each component of t, leading to multiple, independent regression problems. However, a more interesting, and more common, approach is to use the same set of basis functions to model all of the components of the target vector so that y(x, w) = WT\u03c6(x) (3.31) where y is a K-dimensional column vector, W is an M \u00d7 K matrix of parameters, and \u03c6(x) is an M-dimensional column vector with elements \u03c6j(x), with \u03c60(x) = 1 as before. Suppose we take the conditional distribution of the target vector to be an isotropic Gaussian of the form p(t|x, W, \u03b2) = N(t|WT\u03c6(x), \u03b2\u22121I). (3.32) If we have a set of observations t1, . . . , tN, we can combine these into a matrix T of size N \u00d7 K such that the nth row is given by tT n. Similarly, we can combine the input vectors x1, . . . , xN into a matrix X. The log likelihood function is then given by ln p(T|X, W, \u03b2) = N \u0002 n=1 ln N(tn|WT\u03c6(xn), \u03b2\u22121I) = NK 2 ln \u000f \u03b2 2\u03c0 \u0010 \u2212\u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 ''tn \u2212WT\u03c6(xn) ''2 .

N. Thus the solution to the regression problem decouples between the different target variables, and we need only compute a single pseudo-inverse matrix \u03a6\u2020, which is shared by all of the vectors wk. The extension to general Gaussian noise distributions having arbitrary covari- ance matrices is straightforward. Again, this leads to a decoupling into K inde- Exercise 3.6 pendent regression problems. This result is unsurprising because the parameters W de\ufb01ne only the mean of the Gaussian noise distribution, and we know from Sec- tion 2.3.4 that the maximum likelihood solution for the mean of a multivariate Gaus- sian is independent of the covariance. From now on, we shall therefore consider a single target variable t for simplicity. 3.2. The Bias-Variance Decomposition So far in our discussion of linear models for regression, we have assumed that the form and number of basis functions are both \ufb01xed. As we have seen in Chapter 1, the use of maximum likelihood, or equivalently least squares, can lead to severe over-\ufb01tting if complex models are trained using data sets of limited size. However, limiting the number of basis functions in order to avoid over-\ufb01tting has the side effect of limiting the \ufb02exibility of the model to capture interesting and important trends in the data. Although the introduction of regularization terms can control over-\ufb01tting for models with many parameters, this raises the question of how to determine a suitable value for the regularization coef\ufb01cient \u03bb. Seeking the solution that minimizes the regularized error function with respect to both the weight vector w and the regularization coef\ufb01cient \u03bb is clearly not the right approach since this leads to the unregularized solution with \u03bb = 0. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the phenomenon of over-\ufb01tting is really an unfortunate property of maximum likelihood and does not arise when we marginalize over parameters in a Bayesian setting. In this chapter, we shall consider the Bayesian view of model complexity in some depth. Before doing so, however, it is instructive to consider a frequentist viewpoint of the model complexity issue, known as the bias- variance trade-off. Although we shall introduce this concept in the context of linear basis function models, where it is easy to illustrate the ideas using simple examples, the discussion has more general applicability. In Section 1.5.5, when we discussed decision theory for regression problems, we considered various loss functions each of which leads to a corresponding optimal prediction once we are given the conditional distribution p(t|x). A popular choice is",

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION the squared loss function, for which the optimal prediction is given by the conditional expectation, which we denote by h(x) and which is given by h(x) = E[t|x] = \u0006 tp(t|x) dt. (3.36) At this point, it is worth distinguishing between the squared loss function arising from decision theory and the sum-of-squares error function that arose in the maxi- mum likelihood estimation of model parameters. We might use more sophisticated techniques than least squares, for example regularization or a fully Bayesian ap- proach, to determine the conditional distribution p(t|x). These can all be combined with the squared loss function for the purpose of making predictions. We showed in Section 1.5.5 that the expected squared loss can be written in the form E[L] = \u0006 {y(x) \u2212h(x)}2 p(x) dx + \u0006 {h(x) \u2212t}2p(x, t) dx dt. (3.37) Recall that the second term, which is independent of y(x), arises from the intrinsic noise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss. The \ufb01rst term depends on our choice for the function y(x), and we will seek a so- lution for y(x) which makes this term a minimum. Because it is nonnegative, the smallest that we can hope to make this term is zero. If we had an unlimited supply of data (and unlimited computational resources), we could in principle \ufb01nd the regres- sion function h(x) to any desired degree of accuracy, and this would represent the optimal choice for y(x). However, in practice we have a data set D containing only a \ufb01nite number N of data points, and consequently we do not know the regression function h(x) exactly. If we model the h(x) using a parametric function y(x, w) governed by a pa- rameter vector w, then from a Bayesian perspective the uncertainty in our model is expressed through a posterior distribution over w. A frequentist treatment, however, involves making a point estimate of w based on the data set D, and tries instead to interpret the uncertainty of this estimate through the following thought experi- ment. Suppose we had a large number of data sets each of size N and each drawn independently from the distribution p(t, x). For any given data set D, we can run our learning algorithm and obtain a prediction function y(x; D). Different data sets from the ensemble will give different functions and consequently different values of the squared loss. The performance of a particular learning algorithm is then assessed by taking the average over this ensemble of data sets. Consider the integrand of the \ufb01rst term in (3.37), which for a particular data set D takes the form {y(x; D) \u2212h(x)}2. (3.38) Because this quantity will be dependent on the particular data set D, we take its aver- age over the ensemble of data sets. If we add and subtract the quantity ED[y(x; D)]",

(3.39) We now take the expectation of this expression with respect to D and note that the \ufb01nal term will vanish, giving ED \b {y(x; D) \u2212h(x)}2 = {ED[y(x; D)] \u2212h(x)}2 ( )* + (bias)2 + ED \b {y(x; D) \u2212ED[y(x; D)]}2 ( )* + variance . (3.40) We see that the expected squared difference between y(x; D) and the regression function h(x) can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The \ufb01rst term, called the squared bias, represents the extent to which the average prediction over all data sets differs from the desired regression function. The second term, called the variance, measures the extent to which the solutions for individual data sets vary around their average, and hence this measures the extent to which the function y(x; D) is sensitive to the particular choice of data set. We shall provide some intuition to support these de\ufb01nitions shortly when we consider a simple example. So far, we have considered a single input value x. If we substitute this expansion back into (3.37), we obtain the following decomposition of the expected squared loss expected loss = (bias)2 + variance + noise (3.41) where (bias)2 = \u0006 {ED[y(x; D)] \u2212h(x)}2p(x) dx (3.42) variance = \u0006 ED \b {y(x; D) \u2212ED[y(x; D)]}2 p(x) dx (3.43) noise = \u0006 {h(x) \u2212t}2p(x, t) dx dt (3.44) and the bias and variance terms now refer to integrated quantities. Our goal is to minimize the expected loss, which we have decomposed into the sum of a (squared) bias, a variance, and a constant noise term. As we shall see, there is a trade-off between bias and variance, with very \ufb02exible models having low bias and high variance, and relatively rigid models having high bias and low variance. The model with the optimal predictive capability is the one that leads to the best balance between bias and variance. This is illustrated by considering the sinusoidal data set from Chapter 1. Here we generate 100 data sets, each containing N = 25 Appendix A data points, independently from the sinusoidal curve h(x) = sin(2\u03c0x). The data sets are indexed by l = 1, . . . , L, where L = 100, and for each data set D(l) we",

Although the bias-variance decomposition may provide some interesting in- sights into the model complexity issue from a frequentist perspective, it is of lim- ited practical value, because the bias-variance decomposition is based on averages with respect to ensembles of data sets, whereas in practice we have only the single observed data set. If we had a large number of independent training sets of a given size, we would be better off combining them into a single large training set, which of course would reduce the level of over-\ufb01tting for a given model complexity. Given these limitations, we turn in the next section to a Bayesian treatment of linear basis function models, which not only provides powerful insights into the issues of over-\ufb01tting but which also leads to practical techniques for addressing the question model complexity. 3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression In our discussion of maximum likelihood for setting the parameters of a linear re- gression model, we have seen that the effective model complexity, governed by the number of basis functions, needs to be controlled according to the size of the data set. Adding a regularization term to the log likelihood function means the effective model complexity can then be controlled by the value of the regularization coef\ufb01- cient, although the choice of the number and form of the basis functions is of course still important in determining the overall behaviour of the model. This leaves the issue of deciding the appropriate model complexity for the par- ticular problem, which cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood func- tion, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-\ufb01tting. In- dependent hold-out data can be used to determine model complexity, as discussed in Section 1.3, but this can be both computationally expensive and wasteful of valu- able data. We therefore turn to a Bayesian treatment of linear regression, which will avoid the over-\ufb01tting problem of maximum likelihood, and which will also lead to automatic methods of determining model complexity using the training data alone. Again, for simplicity we will focus on the case of a single target variable t. Ex- tension to multiple target variables is straightforward and follows the discussion of Section 3.1.5. 3.3.1 Parameter distribution We begin our discussion of the Bayesian treatment of linear regression by in- troducing a prior probability distribution over the model parameters w. For the mo- ment, we shall treat the noise precision parameter \u03b2 as a known constant. First note that the likelihood function p(t|w) de\ufb01ned by (3.10) is the exponential of a quadratic function of w. The corresponding conjugate prior is therefore given by a Gaussian distribution of the form p(w) = N(w|m0, S0) (3.48) having mean m0 and covariance S0.",

Due to the choice of a conjugate Gaus- sian prior distribution, the posterior will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate this distribution by the usual procedure of completing the square in the exponential, and then \ufb01nding the normalization coef\ufb01cient using the standard result for a normalized Gaussian. However, we have already done the necessary work in deriving the gen- Exercise 3.7 eral result (2.116), which allows us to write down the posterior distribution directly in the form p(w|t) = N(w|mN, SN) (3.49) where mN = SN S\u22121 0 m0 + \u03b2\u03a6Tt (3.50) S\u22121 N = S\u22121 0 + \u03b2\u03a6T\u03a6. (3.51) Note that because the posterior distribution is Gaussian, its mode coincides with its mean. Thus the maximum posterior weight vector is simply given by wMAP = mN. If we consider an in\ufb01nitely broad prior S0 = \u03b1\u22121I with \u03b1 \u21920, the mean mN of the posterior distribution reduces to the maximum likelihood value wML given by (3.15). Similarly, if N = 0, then the posterior distribution reverts to the prior. Furthermore, if data points arrive sequentially, then the posterior distribution at any stage acts as the prior distribution for the subsequent data point, such that the new posterior distribution is again given by (3.49). Exercise 3.8 For the remainder of this chapter, we shall consider a particular form of Gaus- sian prior in order to simplify the treatment. Speci\ufb01cally, we consider a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian governed by a single precision parameter \u03b1 so that p(w|\u03b1) = N(w|0, \u03b1\u22121I) (3.52) and the corresponding posterior distribution over w is then given by (3.49) with mN = \u03b2SN\u03a6Tt (3.53) S\u22121 N = \u03b1I + \u03b2\u03a6T\u03a6. (3.54) The log of the posterior distribution is given by the sum of the log likelihood and the log of the prior and, as a function of w, takes the form ln p(w|t) = \u2212\u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 {tn \u2212wT\u03c6(xn)}2 \u2212\u03b1 2 wTw + const. (3.55) Maximization of this posterior distribution with respect to w is therefore equiva- lent to the minimization of the sum-of-squares error function with the addition of a quadratic regularization term, corresponding to (3.27) with \u03bb = \u03b1/\u03b2. We can illustrate Bayesian learning in a linear basis function model, as well as the sequential update of a posterior distribution, using a simple example involving straight-line \ufb01tting.

Because this has just two adap- tive parameters, we can plot the prior and posterior distributions directly in parameter space. We generate synthetic data from the function f(x, a) = a0+a1x with param- eter values a0 = \u22120.3 and a1 = 0.5 by \ufb01rst choosing values of xn from the uniform distribution U(x|\u22121, 1), then evaluating f(xn, a), and \ufb01nally adding Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 0.2 to obtain the target values tn. Our goal is to recover the values of a0 and a1 from such data, and we will explore the dependence on the size of the data set. We assume here that the noise variance is known and hence we set the precision parameter to its true value \u03b2 = (1/0.2)2 = 25. Similarly, we \ufb01x the parameter \u03b1 to 2.0. We shall shortly discuss strategies for determining \u03b1 and \u03b2 from the training data. Figure 3.7 shows the results of Bayesian learning in this model as the size of the data set is increased and demonstrates the sequential nature of Bayesian learning in which the current posterior distribution forms the prior when a new data point is observed. It is worth taking time to study this \ufb01gure in detail as it illustrates several important aspects of Bayesian inference. The \ufb01rst row of this \ufb01gure corresponds to the situation before any data points are observed and shows a plot of the prior distribution in w space together with six samples of the function y(x, w) in which the values of w are drawn from the prior. In the second row, we see the situation after observing a single data point. The location (x, t) of the data point is shown by a blue circle in the right-hand column. In the left-hand column is a plot of the likelihood function p(t|x, w) for this data point as a function of w. Note that the likelihood function provides a soft constraint that the line must pass close to the data point, where close is determined by the noise precision \u03b2. For comparison, the true parameter values a0 = \u22120.3 and a1 = 0.5 used to generate the data set are shown by a white cross in the plots in the left column of Figure 3.7. When we multiply this likelihood function by the prior from the top row, and normalize, we obtain the posterior distribution shown in the middle plot on the second row. Sam- ples of the regression function y(x, w) obtained by drawing samples of w from this posterior distribution are shown in the right-hand plot. Note that these sample lines all pass close to the data point. The third row of this \ufb01gure shows the effect of ob- serving a second data point, again shown by a blue circle in the plot in the right-hand column. The corresponding likelihood function for this second data point alone is shown in the left plot. When we multiply this likelihood function by the posterior distribution from the second row, we obtain the posterior distribution shown in the middle plot of the third row. Note that this is exactly the same posterior distribution as would be obtained by combining the original prior with the likelihood function for the two data points. This posterior has now been in\ufb02uenced by two data points, and because two points are suf\ufb01cient to de\ufb01ne a line this already gives a relatively compact posterior distribution. Samples from this posterior distribution give rise to the functions shown in red in the third column, and we see that these functions pass close to both of the data points. The fourth row shows the effect of observing a total of 20 data points. The left-hand plot shows the likelihood function for the 20th data point alone, and the middle plot shows the resulting posterior distribution that has now absorbed information from all 20 observations. Note how the posterior is much sharper than in the third row. In the limit of an in\ufb01nite number of data points, the",

Other forms of prior over the parameters can be considered. For instance, we can generalize the Gaussian prior to give p(w|\u03b1) = q 2 \u0011\u03b1 2 \u00121/q 1 \u0393(1/q) M exp \u0016 \u2212\u03b1 2 M \u0002 j=1 |wj|q \u0017 (3.56) in which q = 2 corresponds to the Gaussian distribution, and only in this case is the prior conjugate to the likelihood function (3.10). Finding the maximum of the poste- rior distribution over w corresponds to minimization of the regularized error function (3.29). In the case of the Gaussian prior, the mode of the posterior distribution was equal to the mean, although this will no longer hold if q \u0338= 2. 3.3.2 Predictive distribution In practice, we are not usually interested in the value of w itself but rather in making predictions of t for new values of x. This requires that we evaluate the predictive distribution de\ufb01ned by p(t|t, \u03b1, \u03b2) = \u0006 p(t|w, \u03b2)p(w|t, \u03b1, \u03b2) dw (3.57) in which t is the vector of target values from the training set, and we have omitted the corresponding input vectors from the right-hand side of the conditioning statements to simplify the notation. The conditional distribution p(t|x, w, \u03b2) of the target vari- able is given by (3.8), and the posterior weight distribution is given by (3.49). We see that (3.57) involves the convolution of two Gaussian distributions, and so making use of the result (2.115) from Section 8.1.4, we see that the predictive distribution takes the form Exercise 3.10 p(t|x, t, \u03b1, \u03b2) = N(t|mT N\u03c6(x), \u03c32 N(x)) (3.58) where the variance \u03c32 N(x) of the predictive distribution is given by \u03c32 N(x) = 1 \u03b2 + \u03c6(x)TSN\u03c6(x). (3.59) The \ufb01rst term in (3.59) represents the noise on the data whereas the second term re\ufb02ects the uncertainty associated with the parameters w. Because the noise process and the distribution of w are independent Gaussians, their variances are additive. Note that, as additional data points are observed, the posterior distribution becomes narrower. As a consequence it can be shown (Qazaz et al., 1997) that \u03c32 N+1(x) \u2a7d \u03c32 N(x). In the limit N \u2192\u221e, the second term in (3.59) goes to zero, and the variance Exercise 3.11 of the predictive distribution arises solely from the additive noise governed by the parameter \u03b2.

The data set used to generate this kernel comprised 200 values of x equally spaced over the interval (\u22121, 1). 3.3.3 Equivalent kernel The posterior mean solution (3.53) for the linear basis function model has an in- teresting interpretation that will set the stage for kernel methods, including Gaussian processes. If we substitute (3.53) into the expression (3.3), we see that the predictive Chapter 6 mean can be written in the form y(x, mN) = mT N\u03c6(x) = \u03b2\u03c6(x)TSN\u03a6Tt = N \u0002 n=1 \u03b2\u03c6(x)TSN\u03c6(xn)tn (3.60) where SN is de\ufb01ned by (3.51). Thus the mean of the predictive distribution at a point x is given by a linear combination of the training set target variables tn, so that we can write y(x, mN) = N \u0002 n=1 k(x, xn)tn (3.61) where the function k(x, x\u2032) = \u03b2\u03c6(x)TSN\u03c6(x\u2032) (3.62) is known as the smoother matrix or the equivalent kernel. Regression functions, such as this, which make predictions by taking linear combinations of the training set target values are known as linear smoothers. Note that the equivalent kernel depends on the input values xn from the data set because these appear in the de\ufb01nition of SN. The equivalent kernel is illustrated for the case of Gaussian basis functions in Figure 3.10 in which the kernel functions k(x, x\u2032) have been plotted as a function of x\u2032 for three different values of x. We see that they are localized around x, and so the mean of the predictive distribution at x, given by y(x, mN), is obtained by forming a weighted combination of the target values in which data points close to x are given higher weight than points further removed from x. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that we should weight local evidence more strongly than distant evidence. Note that this localization property holds not only for the localized Gaussian basis functions but also for the nonlocal polynomial and sigmoidal basis functions, as illustrated in Figure 3.11.",

From the form of the equivalent kernel, we see that the predictive mean at nearby points will be highly correlated, whereas for more distant pairs of points the correlation will be smaller. The predictive distribution shown in Figure 3.8 allows us to visualize the point- wise uncertainty in the predictions, governed by (3.59). However, by drawing sam- ples from the posterior distribution over w, and plotting the corresponding model functions y(x, w) as in Figure 3.9, we are visualizing the joint uncertainty in the posterior distribution between the y values at two (or more) x values, as governed by the equivalent kernel. The formulation of linear regression in terms of a kernel function suggests an alternative approach to regression as follows. Instead of introducing a set of basis functions, which implicitly determines an equivalent kernel, we can instead de\ufb01ne a localized kernel directly and use this to make predictions for new input vectors x, given the observed training set. This leads to a practical framework for regression (and classi\ufb01cation) called Gaussian processes, which will be discussed in detail in Section 6.4. We have seen that the effective kernel de\ufb01nes the weights by which the training set target values are combined in order to make a prediction at a new value of x, and it can be shown that these weights sum to one, in other words N \u0002 n=1 k(x, xn) = 1 (3.64) for all values of x. This intuitively pleasing result can easily be proven informally Exercise 3.14 by noting that the summation is equivalent to considering the predictive mean \u0001y(x) for a set of target data in which tn = 1 for all n. Provided the basis functions are linearly independent, that there are more data points than basis functions, and that one of the basis functions is constant (corresponding to the bias parameter), then it is clear that we can \ufb01t the training data exactly and hence that the predictive mean will",

Note that the kernel function can be negative as well as positive, so although it satis\ufb01es a summation constraint, the corresponding predictions are not necessarily convex combinations of the training set target variables. Finally, we note that the equivalent kernel (3.62) satis\ufb01es an important property shared by kernel functions in general, namely that it can be expressed in the form an Chapter 6 inner product with respect to a vector \u03c8(x) of nonlinear functions, so that k(x, z) = \u03c8(x)T\u03c8(z) (3.65) where \u03c8(x) = \u03b21/2S1/2 N \u03c6(x). 3.4. Bayesian Model Comparison In Chapter 1, we highlighted the problem of over-\ufb01tting as well as the use of cross- validation as a technique for setting the values of regularization parameters or for choosing between alternative models. Here we consider the problem of model se- lection from a Bayesian perspective. In this section, our discussion will be very general, and then in Section 3.5 we shall see how these ideas can be applied to the determination of regularization parameters in linear regression. As we shall see, the over-\ufb01tting associated with maximum likelihood can be avoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters in- stead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared di- rectly on the training data, without the need for a validation set. This allows all available data to be used for training and avoids the multiple training runs for each model associated with cross-validation. It also allows multiple complexity parame- ters to be determined simultaneously as part of the training process. For example, in Chapter 7 we shall introduce the relevance vector machine, which is a Bayesian model having one complexity parameter for every training data point. The Bayesian view of model comparison simply involves the use of probabilities to represent uncertainty in the choice of model, along with a consistent application of the sum and product rules of probability. Suppose we wish to compare a set of L models {Mi} where i = 1, . . . , L. Here a model refers to a probability distribution over the observed data D. In the case of the polynomial curve-\ufb01tting problem, the distribution is de\ufb01ned over the set of target values t, while the set of input values X is assumed to be known. Other types of model de\ufb01ne a joint distributions over X and t. We shall suppose that the data is generated from one of these models but we Section 1.5.4 are uncertain which one. Our uncertainty is expressed through a prior probability distribution p(Mi). Given a training set D, we then wish to evaluate the posterior distribution p(Mi|D) \u221dp(Mi)p(D|Mi). (3.66) The prior allows us to express a preference for different models. Let us simply assume that all models are given equal prior probability. The interesting term is the model evidence p(D|Mi) which expresses the preference shown by the data for",

The model evidence is sometimes also called the marginal likelihood because it can be viewed as a likelihood function over the space of models, in which the parameters have been marginalized out. The ratio of model evidences p(D|Mi)/p(D|Mj) for two models is known as a Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995). Once we know the posterior distribution over models, the predictive distribution is given, from the sum and product rules, by p(t|x, D) = L \u0002 i=1 p(t|x, Mi, D)p(Mi|D). (3.67) This is an example of a mixture distribution in which the overall predictive distribu- tion is obtained by averaging the predictive distributions p(t|x, Mi, D) of individual models, weighted by the posterior probabilities p(Mi|D) of those models. For in- stance, if we have two models that are a-posteriori equally likely and one predicts a narrow distribution around t = a while the other predicts a narrow distribution around t = b, the overall predictive distribution will be a bimodal distribution with modes at t = a and t = b, not a single model at t = (a + b)/2. A simple approximation to model averaging is to use the single most probable model alone to make predictions. This is known as model selection. For a model governed by a set of parameters w, the model evidence is given, from the sum and product rules of probability, by p(D|Mi) = \u0006 p(D|w, Mi)p(w|Mi) dw. (3.68) From a sampling perspective, the marginal likelihood can be viewed as the proba- Chapter 11 bility of generating the data set D from a model whose parameters are sampled at random from the prior. It is also interesting to note that the evidence is precisely the normalizing term that appears in the denominator in Bayes\u2019 theorem when evaluating the posterior distribution over parameters because p(w|D, Mi) = p(D|w, Mi)p(w|Mi) p(D|Mi) . (3.69) We can obtain some insight into the model evidence by making a simple approx- imation to the integral over parameters. Consider \ufb01rst the case of a model having a single parameter w. The posterior distribution over parameters is proportional to p(D|w)p(w), where we omit the dependence on the model Mi to keep the notation uncluttered. If we assume that the posterior distribution is sharply peaked around the most probable value wMAP, with width \u2206wposterior, then we can approximate the in- tegral by the value of the integrand at its maximum times the width of the peak. If we further assume that the prior is \ufb02at with width \u2206wprior so that p(w) = 1/\u2206wprior, then we have p(D) = \u0006 p(D|w)p(w) dw \u2243p(D|wMAP)\u2206wposterior \u2206wprior (3.70)",

(3.71) This approximation is illustrated in Figure 3.12. The \ufb01rst term represents the \ufb01t to the data given by the most probable parameter values, and for a \ufb02at prior this would correspond to the log likelihood. The second term penalizes the model according to its complexity. Because \u2206wposterior < \u2206wprior this term is negative, and it increases in magnitude as the ratio \u2206wposterior/\u2206wprior gets smaller. Thus, if parameters are \ufb01nely tuned to the data in the posterior distribution, then the penalty term is large. For a model having a set of M parameters, we can make a similar approximation for each parameter in turn. Assuming that all parameters have the same ratio of \u2206wposterior/\u2206wprior, we obtain ln p(D) \u2243ln p(D|wMAP) + M ln \u000f\u2206wposterior \u2206wprior \u0010 . (3.72) Thus, in this very simple approximation, the size of the complexity penalty increases linearly with the number M of adaptive parameters in the model. As we increase the complexity of the model, the \ufb01rst term will typically decrease, because a more complex model is better able to \ufb01t the data, whereas the second term will increase due to the dependence on M. The optimal model complexity, as determined by the maximum evidence, will be given by a trade-off between these two competing terms. We shall later develop a more re\ufb01ned version of this approximation, based on a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. Section 4.4.1 We can gain further insight into Bayesian model comparison and understand how the marginal likelihood can favour models of intermediate complexity by con- sidering Figure 3.13.

In this example, for the partic- ular observed data set D0, the model M2 with intermedi- ate complexity has the largest evidence. p(D) D D0 M1 M2 M3 model can generate a variety of different data sets since the parameters are governed by a prior probability distribution, and for any choice of the parameters there may be random noise on the target variables. To generate a particular data set from a spe- ci\ufb01c model, we \ufb01rst choose the values of the parameters from their prior distribution p(w), and then for these parameter values we sample the data from p(D|w). A sim- ple model (for example, based on a \ufb01rst order polynomial) has little variability and so will generate data sets that are fairly similar to each other. Its distribution p(D) is therefore con\ufb01ned to a relatively small region of the horizontal axis. By contrast, a complex model (such as a ninth order polynomial) can generate a great variety of different data sets, and so its distribution p(D) is spread over a large region of the space of data sets. Because the distributions p(D|Mi) are normalized, we see that the particular data set D0 can have the highest value of the evidence for the model of intermediate complexity. Essentially, the simpler model cannot \ufb01t the data well, whereas the more complex model spreads its predictive probability over too broad a range of data sets and so assigns relatively small probability to any one of them. Implicit in the Bayesian model comparison framework is the assumption that the true distribution from which the data are generated is contained within the set of models under consideration. Provided this is so, we can show that Bayesian model comparison will on average favour the correct model. To see this, consider two models M1 and M2 in which the truth corresponds to M1. For a given \ufb01nite data set, it is possible for the Bayes factor to be larger for the incorrect model. However, if we average the Bayes factor over the distribution of data sets, we obtain the expected Bayes factor in the form \u0006 p(D|M1) ln p(D|M1) p(D|M2) dD (3.73) where the average has been taken with respect to the true distribution of the data. This quantity is an example of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and satis\ufb01es the prop- Section 1.6.1 erty of always being positive unless the two distributions are equal in which case it is zero. Thus on average the Bayes factor will always favour the correct model. We have seen that the Bayesian framework avoids the problem of over-\ufb01tting and allows models to be compared on the basis of the training data alone. However,",

The Evidence Approximation 165 a Bayesian approach, like any approach to pattern recognition, needs to make as- sumptions about the form of the model, and if these are invalid then the results can be misleading. In particular, we see from Figure 3.12 that the model evidence can be sensitive to many aspects of the prior, such as the behaviour in the tails. Indeed, the evidence is not de\ufb01ned if the prior is improper, as can be seen by noting that an improper prior has an arbitrary scaling factor (in other words, the normalization coef\ufb01cient is not de\ufb01ned because the distribution cannot be normalized). If we con- sider a proper prior and then take a suitable limit in order to obtain an improper prior (for example, a Gaussian prior in which we take the limit of in\ufb01nite variance) then the evidence will go to zero, as can be seen from (3.70) and Figure 3.12. It may, however, be possible to consider the evidence ratio between two models \ufb01rst and then take a limit to obtain a meaningful answer. In a practical application, therefore, it will be wise to keep aside an independent test set of data on which to evaluate the overall performance of the \ufb01nal system. 3.5. The Evidence Approximation In a fully Bayesian treatment of the linear basis function model, we would intro- duce prior distributions over the hyperparameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 and make predictions by marginalizing with respect to these hyperparameters as well as with respect to the parameters w. However, although we can integrate analytically over either w or over the hyperparameters, the complete marginalization over all of these variables is analytically intractable. Here we discuss an approximation in which we set the hyperparameters to speci\ufb01c values determined by maximizing the marginal likeli- hood function obtained by \ufb01rst integrating over the parameters w. This framework is known in the statistics literature as empirical Bayes (Bernardo and Smith, 1994; Gelman et al., 2004), or type 2 maximum likelihood (Berger, 1985), or generalized maximum likelihood (Wahba, 1975), and in the machine learning literature is also called the evidence approximation (Gull, 1989; MacKay, 1992a). If we introduce hyperpriors over \u03b1 and \u03b2, the predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing over w, \u03b1 and \u03b2 so that p(t|t) = \u0006\u0006\u0006 p(t|w, \u03b2)p(w|t, \u03b1, \u03b2)p(\u03b1, \u03b2|t) dw d\u03b1 d\u03b2 (3.74) where p(t|w, \u03b2) is given by (3.8) and p(w|t, \u03b1, \u03b2) is given by (3.49) with mN and SN de\ufb01ned by (3.53) and (3.54) respectively. Here we have omitted the dependence on the input variable x to keep the notation uncluttered. If the posterior distribution p(\u03b1, \u03b2|t) is sharply peaked around values \u0001\u03b1 and \u0001\u03b2, then the predictive distribution is obtained simply by marginalizing over w in which \u03b1 and \u03b2 are \ufb01xed to the values \u0001\u03b1 and \u0001\u03b2, so that p(t|t) \u2243p(t|t, \u0001\u03b1, \u0001\u03b2) = \u0006 p(t|w, \u0001\u03b2)p(w|t, \u0001\u03b1, \u0001\u03b2) dw.

(3.76) If the prior is relatively \ufb02at, then in the evidence framework the values of \u0001\u03b1 and \u0001\u03b2 are obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood function p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2). We shall proceed by evaluating the marginal likelihood for the linear basis function model and then \ufb01nding its maxima. This will allow us to determine values for these hyperpa- rameters from the training data alone, without recourse to cross-validation. Recall that the ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 is analogous to a regularization parameter. As an aside it is worth noting that, if we de\ufb01ne conjugate (Gamma) prior distri- butions over \u03b1 and \u03b2, then the marginalization over these hyperparameters in (3.74) can be performed analytically to give a Student\u2019s t-distribution over w (see Sec- tion 2.3.7). Although the resulting integral over w is no longer analytically tractable, it might be thought that approximating this integral, for example using the Laplace approximation discussed (Section 4.4) which is based on a local Gaussian approxi- mation centred on the mode of the posterior distribution, might provide a practical alternative to the evidence framework (Buntine and Weigend, 1991). However, the integrand as a function of w typically has a strongly skewed mode so that the Laplace approximation fails to capture the bulk of the probability mass, leading to poorer re- sults than those obtained by maximizing the evidence (MacKay, 1999). Returning to the evidence framework, we note that there are two approaches that we can take to the maximization of the log evidence. We can evaluate the evidence function analytically and then set its derivative equal to zero to obtain re-estimation equations for \u03b1 and \u03b2, which we shall do in Section 3.5.2. Alternatively we use a technique called the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which will be dis- cussed in Section 9.3.4 where we shall also show that these two approaches converge to the same solution. 3.5.1 Evaluation of the evidence function The marginal likelihood function p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2) is obtained by integrating over the weight parameters w, so that p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u0006 p(t|w, \u03b2)p(w|\u03b1) dw. (3.77) One way to evaluate this integral is to make use once again of the result (2.115) for the conditional distribution in a linear-Gaussian model. Here we shall evaluate Exercise 3.16 the integral instead by completing the square in the exponent and making use of the standard form for the normalization coef\ufb01cient of a Gaussian. From (3.11), (3.12), and (3.52), we can write the evidence function in the form Exercise 3.17 p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u000f \u03b2 2\u03c0 \u0010N/2 \u0011 \u03b1 2\u03c0 \u0012M/2 \u0006 exp {\u2212E(w)} dw (3.78)",

(3.79) We recognize (3.79) as being equal, up to a constant of proportionality, to the reg- ularized sum-of-squares error function (3.27). We now complete the square over w Exercise 3.18 giving E(w) = E(mN) + 1 2(w \u2212mN)TA(w \u2212mN) (3.80) where we have introduced A = \u03b1I + \u03b2\u03a6T\u03a6 (3.81) together with E(mN) = \u03b2 2 \u2225t \u2212\u03a6mN\u22252 + \u03b1 2 mT NmN. (3.82) Note that A corresponds to the matrix of second derivatives of the error function A = \u2207\u2207E(w) (3.83) and is known as the Hessian matrix. Here we have also de\ufb01ned mN given by mN = \u03b2A\u22121\u03a6Tt. (3.84) Using (3.54), we see that A = S\u22121 N , and hence (3.84) is equivalent to the previous de\ufb01nition (3.53), and therefore represents the mean of the posterior distribution. The integral over w can now be evaluated simply by appealing to the standard result for the normalization coef\ufb01cient of a multivariate Gaussian, giving Exercise 3.19 \u0006 exp {\u2212E(w)} dw = exp{\u2212E(mN)} \u0006 exp \u22121 2(w \u2212mN)TA(w \u2212mN) dw = exp{\u2212E(mN)}(2\u03c0)M/2|A|\u22121/2.

Returning to the polynomial regression problem, we can plot the model evidence against the order of the polynomial, as shown in Figure 3.14. Here we have assumed a prior of the form (1.65) with the parameter \u03b1 \ufb01xed at \u03b1 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123. The form of this plot is very instructive. Referring back to Figure 1.4, we see that the M = 0 polynomial has very poor \ufb01t to the data and consequently gives a relatively low value",

However, in going to M = 2, the data \ufb01t is improved only very marginally, due to the fact that the underlying sinusoidal function from which the data is generated is an odd function and so has no even terms in a polynomial expansion. Indeed, Figure 1.5 shows that the residual data error is reduced only slightly in going from M = 1 to M = 2. Because this richer model suffers a greater complexity penalty, the evidence actually falls in going from M = 1 to M = 2. When we go to M = 3 we obtain a signi\ufb01cant further improvement in data \ufb01t, as seen in Figure 1.4, and so the evidence is increased again, giving the highest overall evidence for any of the polynomials. Further increases in the value of M produce only small improvements in the \ufb01t to the data but suffer increasing complexity penalty, leading overall to a decrease in the evidence values. Looking again at Figure 1.5, we see that the generalization error is roughly constant between M = 3 and M = 8, and it would be dif\ufb01cult to choose between these models on the basis of this plot alone. The evidence values, however, show a clear preference for M = 3, since this is the simplest model which gives a good explanation for the observed data. 3.5.2 Maximizing the evidence function Let us \ufb01rst consider the maximization of p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2) with respect to \u03b1. This can be done by \ufb01rst de\ufb01ning the following eigenvector equation \u03b2\u03a6T\u03a6 ui = \u03bbiui. (3.87) From (3.81), it then follows that A has eigenvalues \u03b1+\u03bbi. Now consider the deriva- tive of the term involving ln |A| in (3.86) with respect to \u03b1. We have d d\u03b1 ln |A| = d d\u03b1 ln \u000e i (\u03bbi + \u03b1) = d d\u03b1 \u0002 i ln(\u03bbi + \u03b1) = \u0002 i 1 \u03bbi + \u03b1. (3.88) Thus the stationary points of (3.86) with respect to \u03b1 satisfy 0 = M 2\u03b1 \u22121 2mT NmN \u22121 2 \u0002 i 1 \u03bbi + \u03b1. (3.89)",

(3.90) Since there are M terms in the sum over i, the quantity \u03b3 can be written \u03b3 = \u0002 i \u03bbi \u03b1 + \u03bbi . (3.91) The interpretation of the quantity \u03b3 will be discussed shortly. From (3.90) we see that the value of \u03b1 that maximizes the marginal likelihood satis\ufb01es Exercise 3.20 \u03b1 = \u03b3 mT NmN . (3.92) Note that this is an implicit solution for \u03b1 not only because \u03b3 depends on \u03b1, but also because the mode mN of the posterior distribution itself depends on the choice of \u03b1. We therefore adopt an iterative procedure in which we make an initial choice for \u03b1 and use this to \ufb01nd mN, which is given by (3.53), and also to evaluate \u03b3, which is given by (3.91). These values are then used to re-estimate \u03b1 using (3.92), and the process repeated until convergence. Note that because the matrix \u03a6T\u03a6 is \ufb01xed, we can compute its eigenvalues once at the start and then simply multiply these by \u03b2 to obtain the \u03bbi. It should be emphasized that the value of \u03b1 has been determined purely by look- ing at the training data. In contrast to maximum likelihood methods, no independent data set is required in order to optimize the model complexity. We can similarly maximize the log marginal likelihood (3.86) with respect to \u03b2. To do this, we note that the eigenvalues \u03bbi de\ufb01ned by (3.87) are proportional to \u03b2, and hence d\u03bbi/d\u03b2 = \u03bbi/\u03b2 giving d d\u03b2 ln |A| = d d\u03b2 \u0002 i ln(\u03bbi + \u03b1) = 1 \u03b2 \u0002 i \u03bbi \u03bbi + \u03b1 = \u03b3 \u03b2 .

(3.95) Again, this is an implicit solution for \u03b2 and can be solved by choosing an initial value for \u03b2 and then using this to calculate mN and \u03b3 and then re-estimate \u03b2 using (3.95), repeating until convergence. If both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are to be determined from the data, then their values can be re-estimated together after each update of \u03b3.",

By contrast, in the direction w2 the eigenvalue \u03bb2 is large compared with \u03b1 and so the quantity \u03bb2/(\u03bb2 +\u03b1) is close to unity, and the MAP value of w2 is close to its maximum likelihood value. u1 u2 w1 w2 wMAP wML 3.5.3 Effective number of parameters The result (3.92) has an elegant interpretation (MacKay, 1992a), which provides insight into the Bayesian solution for \u03b1. To see this, consider the contours of the like- lihood function and the prior as illustrated in Figure 3.15. Here we have implicitly transformed to a rotated set of axes in parameter space aligned with the eigenvec- tors ui de\ufb01ned in (3.87). Contours of the likelihood function are then axis-aligned ellipses. The eigenvalues \u03bbi measure the curvature of the likelihood function, and so in Figure 3.15 the eigenvalue \u03bb1 is small compared with \u03bb2 (because a smaller curvature corresponds to a greater elongation of the contours of the likelihood func- tion). Because \u03b2\u03a6T\u03a6 is a positive de\ufb01nite matrix, it will have positive eigenvalues, and so the ratio \u03bbi/(\u03bbi + \u03b1) will lie between 0 and 1. Consequently, the quantity \u03b3 de\ufb01ned by (3.91) will lie in the range 0 \u2a7d\u03b3 \u2a7dM. For directions in which \u03bbi \u226b\u03b1, the corresponding parameter wi will be close to its maximum likelihood value, and the ratio \u03bbi/(\u03bbi + \u03b1) will be close to 1. Such parameters are called well determined because their values are tightly constrained by the data. Conversely, for directions in which \u03bbi \u226a\u03b1, the corresponding parameters wi will be close to zero, as will the ratios \u03bbi/(\u03bbi +\u03b1). These are directions in which the likelihood function is relatively insensitive to the parameter value and so the parameter has been set to a small value by the prior. The quantity \u03b3 de\ufb01ned by (3.91) therefore measures the effective total number of well determined parameters. We can obtain some insight into the result (3.95) for re-estimating \u03b2 by com- paring it with the corresponding maximum likelihood result given by (3.21). Both of these formulae express the variance (the inverse precision) as an average of the squared differences between the targets and the model predictions. However, they differ in that the number of data points N in the denominator of the maximum like- lihood result is replaced by N \u2212\u03b3 in the Bayesian result.

In effect, this has used up one degree of freedom in the model. The corresponding unbiased estimate is given by (1.59) and takes the form \u03c32 MAP = 1 N \u22121 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5ML)2. (3.97) We shall see in Section 10.1.3 that this result can be obtained from a Bayesian treat- ment in which we marginalize over the unknown mean. The factor of N \u22121 in the denominator of the Bayesian result takes account of the fact that one degree of free- dom has been used in \ufb01tting the mean and removes the bias of maximum likelihood. Now consider the corresponding results for the linear regression model. The mean of the target distribution is now given by the function wT\u03c6(x), which contains M parameters. However, not all of these parameters are tuned to the data. The effective number of parameters that are determined by the data is \u03b3, with the remaining M \u2212\u03b3 parameters set to small values by the prior. This is re\ufb02ected in the Bayesian result for the variance that has a factor N \u2212\u03b3 in the denominator, thereby correcting for the bias of the maximum likelihood result. We can illustrate the evidence framework for setting hyperparameters using the sinusoidal synthetic data set from Section 1.1, together with the Gaussian basis func- tion model comprising 9 basis functions, so that the total number of parameters in the model is given by M = 10 including the bias. Here, for simplicity of illustra- tion, we have set \u03b2 to its true value of 11.1 and then used the evidence framework to determine \u03b1, as shown in Figure 3.16. We can also see how the parameter \u03b1 controls the magnitude of the parameters {wi}, by plotting the individual parameters versus the effective number \u03b3 of param- eters, as shown in Figure 3.17. If we consider the limit N \u226bM in which the number of data points is large in relation to the number of parameters, then from (3.87) all of the parameters will be well determined by the data because \u03a6T\u03a6 involves an implicit sum over data points, and so the eigenvalues \u03bbi increase with the size of the data set. In this case, \u03b3 = M, and the re-estimation equations for \u03b1 and \u03b2 become \u03b1 = M 2EW (mN) (3.98) \u03b2 = N 2ED(mN) (3.99) where EW and ED are de\ufb01ned by (3.25) and (3.26), respectively.

Fortunately, there are two properties of real data sets that we can exploit to help alleviate this problem. First of all, the data vectors {xn} typically lie close to a non- linear manifold whose intrinsic dimensionality is smaller than that of the input space as a result of strong correlations between the input variables. We will see an example of this when we consider images of handwritten digits in Chapter 12. If we are using localized basis functions, we can arrange that they are scattered in input space only in regions containing data. This approach is used in radial basis function networks and also in support vector and relevance vector machines. Neural network models, which use adaptive basis functions having sigmoidal nonlinearities, can adapt the parameters so that the regions of input space over which the basis functions vary corresponds to the data manifold. The second property is that target variables may have signi\ufb01cant dependence on only a small number of possible directions within the data manifold. Neural networks can exploit this property by choosing the directions in input space to which the basis functions respond.

We now discuss an analogous class of models for solving classi\ufb01cation problems. The goal in classi\ufb01cation is to take an input vector x and to assign it to one of K discrete classes Ck where k = 1, . . . , K. In the most common scenario, the classes are taken to be disjoint, so that each input is assigned to one and only one class. The input space is thereby divided into decision regions whose boundaries are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces.

    "text": "180 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION ways of using target values to represent class labels. For probabilistic models, the most convenient, in the case of two-class problems, is the binary representation in which there is a single target variable t \u2208{0, 1} such that t = 1 represents class C1 and t = 0 represents class C2. We can interpret the value of t as the probability that the class is C1, with the values of probability taking only the extreme values of 0 and 1. For K > 2 classes, it is convenient to use a 1-of-K coding scheme in which t is a vector of length K such that if the class is Cj, then all elements tk of t are zero except element tj, which takes the value 1. For instance, if we have K = 5 classes, then a pattern from class 2 would be given the target vector t = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T. (4.1) Again, we can interpret the value of tk as the probability that the class is Ck. For nonprobabilistic models, alternative choices of target variable representation will sometimes prove convenient. In Chapter 1, we identi\ufb01ed three distinct approaches to the classi\ufb01cation prob- lem. The simplest involves constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns each vector x to a speci\ufb01c class. A more powerful approach, however, models the conditional probability distribution p(Ck|x) in an inference stage, and then subse- quently uses this distribution to make optimal decisions. By separating inference and decision, we gain numerous bene\ufb01ts, as discussed in Section 1.5.4. There are two different approaches to determining the conditional probabilities p(Ck|x). One technique is to model them directly, for example by representing them as parametric models and then optimizing the parameters using a training set. Alternatively, we can adopt a generative approach in which we model the class-conditional densities given by p(x|Ck), together with the prior probabilities p(Ck) for the classes, and then we compute the required posterior probabilities using Bayes\u2019 theorem p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) . (4.2) We shall discuss examples of all three approaches in this chapter. In the linear regression models considered in Chapter 3, the model prediction y(x, w) was given by a linear function of the parameters w. In the simplest case, the model is also linear in the input variables and therefore takes the form y(x) = wTx+w0, so that y is a real number. For classi\ufb01cation problems, however, we wish to predict discrete class labels, or more generally posterior probabilities that lie in the range (0, 1). To achieve this, we consider a generalization of this model in which we transform the linear function of w using a nonlinear function f( \u00b7 ) so that y(x) = f wTx + w0 . (4.3) In the machine learning literature f( \u00b7 ) is known as an activation function, whereas its inverse is called a link function in the statistics literature. The decision surfaces correspond to y(x) = constant, so that wTx + w0 = constant and hence the deci- sion surfaces are linear functions of x, even if the function f(\u00b7) is nonlinear. For this reason, the class of models described by (4.3) are called generalized linear models",

Note, however, that in contrast to the models used for regression, they are no longer linear in the parameters due to the presence of the nonlinear function f(\u00b7). This will lead to more complex analytical and computa- tional properties than for linear regression models. Nevertheless, these models are still relatively simple compared to the more general nonlinear models that will be studied in subsequent chapters. The algorithms discussed in this chapter will be equally applicable if we \ufb01rst make a \ufb01xed nonlinear transformation of the input variables using a vector of basis functions \u03c6(x) as we did for regression models in Chapter 3. We begin by consider- ing classi\ufb01cation directly in the original input space x, while in Section 4.3 we shall \ufb01nd it convenient to switch to a notation involving basis functions for consistency with later chapters. 4.1. Discriminant Functions A discriminant is a function that takes an input vector x and assigns it to one of K classes, denoted Ck. In this chapter, we shall restrict attention to linear discriminants, namely those for which the decision surfaces are hyperplanes. To simplify the dis- cussion, we consider \ufb01rst the case of two classes and then investigate the extension to K > 2 classes. 4.1.1 Two classes The simplest representation of a linear discriminant function is obtained by tak- ing a linear function of the input vector so that y(x) = wTx + w0 (4.4) where w is called a weight vector, and w0 is a bias (not to be confused with bias in the statistical sense). The negative of the bias is sometimes called a threshold. An input vector x is assigned to class C1 if y(x) \u2a7e0 and to class C2 otherwise. The cor- responding decision boundary is therefore de\ufb01ned by the relation y(x) = 0, which corresponds to a (D \u22121)-dimensional hyperplane within the D-dimensional input space. Consider two points xA and xB both of which lie on the decision surface. Because y(xA) = y(xB) = 0, we have wT(xA \u2212xB) = 0 and hence the vector w is orthogonal to every vector lying within the decision surface, and so w determines the orientation of the decision surface. Similarly, if x is a point on the decision surface, then y(x) = 0, and so the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is given by wTx \u2225w\u2225= \u2212w0 \u2225w\u2225. (4.5) We therefore see that the bias parameter w0 determines the location of the decision surface. These properties are illustrated for the case of D = 2 in Figure 4.1. Furthermore, we note that the value of y(x) gives a signed measure of the per- pendicular distance r of the point x from the decision surface. To see this, consider",

(4.6) Multiplying both sides of this result by wT and adding w0, and making use of y(x) = wTx + w0 and y(x\u22a5) = wTx\u22a5+ w0 = 0, we have r = y(x) \u2225w\u2225. (4.7) This result is illustrated in Figure 4.1. As with the linear regression models in Chapter 3, it is sometimes convenient to use a more compact notation in which we introduce an additional dummy \u2018input\u2019 value x0 = 1 and then de\ufb01ne \u0004w = (w0, w) and \u0004x = (x0, x) so that y(x) = \u0004wT\u0004x.

On the right is an example involving three discriminant functions each of which is used to separate a pair of classes Ck and Cj. example involving three classes where this approach leads to regions of input space that are ambiguously classi\ufb01ed. An alternative is to introduce K(K \u22121)/2 binary discriminant functions, one for every possible pair of classes. This is known as a one-versus-one classi\ufb01er. Each point is then classi\ufb01ed according to a majority vote amongst the discriminant func- tions. However, this too runs into the problem of ambiguous regions, as illustrated in the right-hand diagram of Figure 4.2. We can avoid these dif\ufb01culties by considering a single K-class discriminant comprising K linear functions of the form yk(x) = wT k x + wk0 (4.9) and then assigning a point x to class Ck if yk(x) > yj(x) for all j \u0338= k.

(4.12) Because both xA and xB lie inside Rk, it follows that yk(xA) > yj(xA), and yk(xB) > yj(xB), for all j \u0338= k, and hence yk(\u0001x) > yj(\u0001x), and so \u0001x also lies inside Rk. Thus Rk is singly connected and convex. Note that for two classes, we can either employ the formalism discussed here, based on two discriminant functions y1(x) and y2(x), or else use the simpler but equivalent formulation described in Section 4.1.1 based on a single discriminant function y(x). We now explore three approaches to learning the parameters of linear discrimi- nant functions, based on least squares, Fisher\u2019s linear discriminant, and the percep- tron algorithm. 4.1.3 Least squares for classi\ufb01cation In Chapter 3, we considered models that were linear functions of the parame- ters, and we saw that the minimization of a sum-of-squares error function led to a simple closed-form solution for the parameter values. It is therefore tempting to see if we can apply the same formalism to classi\ufb01cation problems. Consider a general classi\ufb01cation problem with K classes, with a 1-of-K binary coding scheme for the target vector t. One justi\ufb01cation for using least squares in such a context is that it approximates the conditional expectation E[t|x] of the target values given the input vector. For the binary coding scheme, this conditional expectation is given by the vector of posterior class probabilities. Unfortunately, however, these probabilities are typically approximated rather poorly, indeed the approximations can have values outside the range (0, 1), due to the limited \ufb02exibility of a linear model as we shall see shortly. Each class Ck is described by its own linear model so that yk(x) = wT k x + wk0 (4.13) where k = 1, . . . , K.

Consider a training data set {xn, tn} where n = 1, . . . , N, and de\ufb01ne a matrix T whose nth row is the vector tT n, together with a matrix \u0004X whose nth row is \u0004xT n. The sum-of-squares error function can then be written as ED(, W) = 1 2Tr \u0013 (\u0004X, W \u2212T)T(\u0004X, W \u2212T) \u0014 . (4.15) Setting the derivative with respect to , W to zero, and rearranging, we then obtain the solution for , W in the form , W = (\u0004XT \u0004X)\u22121 \u0004XTT = \u0004X\u2020T (4.16) where \u0004X\u2020 is the pseudo-inverse of the matrix \u0004X, as discussed in Section 3.1.1. We then obtain the discriminant function in the form y(x) = , WT\u0004x = TT \u0011 \u0004X\u2020\u0012T \u0004x. (4.17) An interesting property of least-squares solutions with multiple target variables is that if every target vector in the training set satis\ufb01es some linear constraint aTtn + b = 0 (4.18) for some constants a and b, then the model prediction for any value of x will satisfy the same constraint so that Exercise 4.2 aTy(x) + b = 0. (4.19) Thus if we use a 1-of-K coding scheme for K classes, then the predictions made by the model will have the property that the elements of y(x) will sum to 1 for any value of x. However, this summation constraint alone is not suf\ufb01cient to allow the model outputs to be interpreted as probabilities because they are not constrained to lie within the interval (0, 1). The least-squares approach gives an exact closed-form solution for the discrimi- nant function parameters. However, even as a discriminant function (where we use it to make decisions directly and dispense with any probabilistic interpretation) it suf- fers from some severe problems. We have already seen that least-squares solutions Section 2.3.7 lack robustness to outliers, and this applies equally to the classi\ufb01cation application, as illustrated in Figure 4.4. Here we see that the additional data points in the right- hand \ufb01gure produce a signi\ufb01cant change in the location of the decision boundary, even though these point would be correctly classi\ufb01ed by the original decision bound- ary in the left-hand \ufb01gure. The sum-of-squares error function penalizes predictions that are \u2018too correct\u2019 in that they lie a long way on the correct side of the decision",

In Section 7.1.2, we shall consider several alternative error functions for classi\ufb01cation and we shall see that they do not suffer from this dif\ufb01culty. However, problems with least squares can be more severe than simply lack of robustness, as illustrated in Figure 4.5. This shows a synthetic data set drawn from three classes in a two-dimensional input space (x1, x2), having the property that lin- ear decision boundaries can give excellent separation between the classes. Indeed, the technique of logistic regression, described later in this chapter, gives a satisfac- tory solution as seen in the right-hand plot. However, the least-squares solution gives poor results, with only a small region of the input space assigned to the green class. The failure of least squares should not surprise us when we recall that it cor- responds to maximum likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian conditional distribution, whereas binary target vectors clearly have a distribution that is far from Gaussian. By adopting more appropriate probabilistic models, we shall obtain clas- si\ufb01cation techniques with much better properties than least squares.

In general, the projection onto one dimension leads to a considerable loss of infor- mation, and classes that are well separated in the original D-dimensional space may become strongly overlapping in one dimension. However, by adjusting the com- ponents of the weight vector w, we can select a projection that maximizes the class separation. To begin with, consider a two-class problem in which there are N1 points of class C1 and N2 points of class C2, so that the mean vectors of the two classes are given by m1 = 1 N1 \u0002 n \u2208C1 xn, m2 = 1 N2 \u0002 n \u2208C2 xn. (4.21) The simplest measure of the separation of the classes, when projected onto w, is the separation of the projected class means. This suggests that we might choose w so as to maximize m2 \u2212m1 = wT(m2 \u2212m1) (4.22) where mk = wTmk (4.23)",

However, this expression can be made arbitrarily large simply by increasing the magnitude of w. To solve this problem, we could constrain w to have unit length, so that \u0005 i w2 i = 1.

There is still a problem with this approach, however, as illustrated Exercise 4.4 in Figure 4.6. This shows two classes that are well separated in the original two- dimensional space (x1, x2) but that have considerable overlap when projected onto the line joining their means. This dif\ufb01culty arises from the strongly nondiagonal covariances of the class distributions. The idea proposed by Fisher is to maximize a function that will give a large separation between the projected class means while also giving a small variance within each class, thereby minimizing the class overlap. The projection formula (4.20) transforms the set of labelled data points in x into a labelled set in the one-dimensional space y. The within-class variance of the transformed data from class Ck is therefore given by s2 k = \u0002 n\u2208Ck (yn \u2212mk)2 (4.24) where yn = wTxn. We can de\ufb01ne the total within-class variance for the whole data set to be simply s2 1 + s2 2.

Furthermore, we do not care about the magnitude of w, only its direction, and so we can drop the scalar factors (wTSBw) and (wTSWw). Multiplying both sides of (4.29) by S\u22121 W we then obtain w \u221dS\u22121 W (m2 \u2212m1).

The result (4.30) is known as Fisher\u2019s linear discriminant, although strictly it is not a discriminant but rather a speci\ufb01c choice of direction for projection of the data down to one dimension. However, the projected data can subsequently be used to construct a discriminant, by choosing a threshold y0 so that we classify a new point as belonging to C1 if y(x) \u2a7ey0 and classify it as belonging to C2 otherwise. For example, we can model the class-conditional densities p(y|Ck) using Gaussian distributions and then use the techniques of Section 1.2.4 to \ufb01nd the parameters of the Gaussian distributions by maximum likelihood. Having found Gaussian ap- proximations to the projected classes, the formalism of Section 1.5.1 then gives an expression for the optimal threshold. Some justi\ufb01cation for the Gaussian assumption comes from the central limit theorem by noting that y = wTx is the sum of a set of random variables. 4.1.5 Relation to least squares The least-squares approach to the determination of a linear discriminant was based on the goal of making the model predictions as close as possible to a set of target values. By contrast, the Fisher criterion was derived by requiring maximum class separation in the output space. It is interesting to see the relationship between these two approaches. In particular, we shall show that, for the two-class problem, the Fisher criterion can be obtained as a special case of least squares. So far we have considered 1-of-K coding for the target values.

In particular, we shall take the targets for class C1 to be N/N1, where N1 is the number of patterns in class C1, and N is the total number of patterns. This target value approximates the reciprocal of the prior probability for class C1. For class C2, we shall take the targets to be \u2212N/N2, where N2 is the number of patterns in class C2. The sum-of-squares error function can be written E = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 wTxn + w0 \u2212tn 2 . (4.31) Setting the derivatives of E with respect to w0 and w to zero, we obtain respectively N \u0002 n=1 wTxn + w0 \u2212tn = 0 (4.32) N \u0002 n=1 wTxn + w0 \u2212tn xn = 0. (4.33) From (4.32), and making use of our choice of target coding scheme for the tn, we obtain an expression for the bias in the form w0 = \u2212wTm (4.34) where we have used N \u0002 n=1 tn = N1 N N1 \u2212N2 N N2 = 0 (4.35) and where m is the mean of the total data set and is given by m = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 xn = 1 N (N1m1 + N2m2).

(4.49) Again we wish to construct a scalar that is large when the between-class covariance is large and when the within-class covariance is small. There are now many possible choices of criterion (Fukunaga, 1990). One example is given by J(W) = Tr \u001a s\u22121 W sB \u001b . (4.50) This criterion can then be rewritten as an explicit function of the projection matrix W in the form J(w) = Tr \u001a (WSWWT)\u22121(WSBWT)\u001b . (4.51) Maximization of such criteria is straightforward, though somewhat involved, and is discussed at length in Fukunaga (1990). The weight values are determined by those eigenvectors of S\u22121 W SB that correspond to the D\u2032 largest eigenvalues. There is one important result that is common to all such criteria, which is worth emphasizing. We \ufb01rst note from (4.46) that SB is composed of the sum of K ma- trices, each of which is an outer product of two vectors and therefore of rank 1. In addition, only (K \u22121) of these matrices are independent as a result of the constraint (4.44). Thus, SB has rank at most equal to (K \u22121) and so there are at most (K \u22121) nonzero eigenvalues. This shows that the projection onto the (K \u22121)-dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of SB does not alter the value of J(w), and so we are therefore unable to \ufb01nd more than (K \u22121) linear \u2018features\u2019 by this means (Fukunaga, 1990). 4.1.7 The perceptron algorithm Another example of a linear discriminant model is the perceptron of Rosenblatt (1962), which occupies an important place in the history of pattern recognition al- gorithms. It corresponds to a two-class model in which the input vector x is \ufb01rst transformed using a \ufb01xed nonlinear transformation to give a feature vector \u03c6(x), and this is then used to construct a generalized linear model of the form y(x) = f wT\u03c6(x) (4.52)",

(4.53) The vector \u03c6(x) will typically include a bias component \u03c60(x) = 1. In earlier discussions of two-class classi\ufb01cation problems, we have focussed on a target coding scheme in which t \u2208{0, 1}, which is appropriate in the context of probabilistic models. For the perceptron, however, it is more convenient to use target values t = +1 for class C1 and t = \u22121 for class C2, which matches the choice of activation function. The algorithm used to determine the parameters w of the perceptron can most easily be motivated by error function minimization. A natural choice of error func- tion would be the total number of misclassi\ufb01ed patterns. However, this does not lead to a simple learning algorithm because the error is a piecewise constant function of w, with discontinuities wherever a change in w causes the decision boundary to move across one of the data points. Methods based on changing w using the gradi- ent of the error function cannot then be applied, because the gradient is zero almost everywhere. We therefore consider an alternative error function known as the perceptron cri- terion. To derive this, we note that we are seeking a weight vector w such that patterns xn in class C1 will have wT\u03c6(xn) > 0, whereas patterns xn in class C2 have wT\u03c6(xn) < 0. Using the t \u2208{\u22121, +1} target coding scheme it follows that we would like all patterns to satisfy wT\u03c6(xn)tn > 0. The perceptron criterion associates zero error with any pattern that is correctly classi\ufb01ed, whereas for a mis- classi\ufb01ed pattern xn it tries to minimize the quantity \u2212wT\u03c6(xn)tn.

Initially, Rosenblatt simulated the perceptron on an IBM 704 computer at Cornell in 1957, but by the early 1960s he had built special-purpose hardware that provided a direct, par- allel implementation of perceptron learning. Many of his ideas were encapsulated in \u201cPrinciples of Neuro- dynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mech- anisms\u201d published in 1962. Rosenblatt\u2019s work was criticized by Marvin Minksy, whose objections were published in the book \u201cPerceptrons\u201d, co-authored with Seymour Papert. This book was widely misinter- preted at the time as showing that neural networks were fatally \ufb02awed and could only learn solutions for linearly separable problems. In fact, it only proved such limitations in the case of single-layer networks such as the perceptron and merely conjectured (in- correctly) that they applied to more general network models. Unfortunately, however, this book contributed to the substantial decline in research funding for neu- ral computing, a situation that was not reversed un- til the mid-1980s. Today, there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of applications of neural networks in widespread use, with examples in areas such as handwriting recognition and information retrieval be- ing used routinely by millions of people.",

The contribution to the error associated with a particular misclassi\ufb01ed pattern is a linear function of w in regions of w space where the pattern is misclassi\ufb01ed and zero in regions where it is correctly classi\ufb01ed. The total error function is therefore piecewise linear. We now apply the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this error function. Section 3.1.3 The change in the weight vector w is then given by w(\u03c4+1) = w(\u03c4) \u2212\u03b7\u2207EP(w) = w(\u03c4) + \u03b7\u03c6ntn (4.55) where \u03b7 is the learning rate parameter and \u03c4 is an integer that indexes the steps of the algorithm. Because the perceptron function y(x, w) is unchanged if we multiply w by a constant, we can set the learning rate parameter \u03b7 equal to 1 without of generality. Note that, as the weight vector evolves during training, the set of patterns that are misclassi\ufb01ed will change. The perceptron learning algorithm has a simple interpretation, as follows. We cycle through the training patterns in turn, and for each pattern xn we evaluate the perceptron function (4.52). If the pattern is correctly classi\ufb01ed, then the weight vector remains unchanged, whereas if it is incorrectly classi\ufb01ed, then for class C1 we add the vector \u03c6(xn) onto the current estimate of weight vector w while for class C2 we subtract the vector \u03c6(xn) from w. The perceptron learning algorithm is illustrated in Figure 4.7. If we consider the effect of a single update in the perceptron learning algorithm, we see that the contribution to the error from a misclassi\ufb01ed pattern will be reduced because from (4.55) we have \u2212w(\u03c4+1)T\u03c6ntn = \u2212w(\u03c4)T\u03c6ntn \u2212(\u03c6ntn)T\u03c6ntn < \u2212w(\u03c4)T\u03c6ntn (4.56) where we have set \u03b7 = 1, and made use of \u2225\u03c6ntn\u22252 > 0. Of course, this does not imply that the contribution to the error function from the other misclassi\ufb01ed patterns will have been reduced. Furthermore, the change in weight vector may have caused some previously correctly classi\ufb01ed patterns to become misclassi\ufb01ed. Thus the perceptron learning rule is not guaranteed to reduce the total error function at each stage. However, the perceptron convergence theorem states that if there exists an ex- act solution (in other words, if the training data set is linearly separable), then the perceptron learning algorithm is guaranteed to \ufb01nd an exact solution in a \ufb01nite num- ber of steps. Proofs of this theorem can be found for example in Rosenblatt (1962), Block (1962), Nilsson (1965), Minsky and Papert (1969), Hertz et al. (1991), and Bishop (1995a). Note, however, that the number of steps required to achieve con- vergence could still be substantial, and in practice, until convergence is achieved, we will not be able to distinguish between a nonseparable problem and one that is simply slow to converge. Even when the data set is linearly separable, there may be many solutions, and which one is found will depend on the initialization of the parameters and on the or- der of presentation of the data points. Furthermore, for data sets that are not linearly separable, the perceptron learning algorithm will never converge.",

The perceptron also had a patch board, shown in the middle photograph, which allowed different con\ufb01gurations of input features to be tried. Often these were wired up at random to demonstrate the ability of the perceptron to learn without the need for precise wiring, in contrast to a modern digital computer. The photograph on the right shows one of the racks of adaptive weights. Each weight was implemented using a rotary variable resistor, also called a potentiometer, driven by an electric motor thereby allowing the value of the weight to be adjusted automatically by the learning algorithm. Aside from dif\ufb01culties with the learning algorithm, the perceptron does not pro- vide probabilistic outputs, nor does it generalize readily to K > 2 classes. The most important limitation, however, arises from the fact that (in common with all of the models discussed in this chapter and the previous one) it is based on linear com- binations of \ufb01xed basis functions. More detailed discussions of the limitations of perceptrons can be found in Minsky and Papert (1969) and Bishop (1995a). Analogue hardware implementations of the perceptron were built by Rosenblatt, based on motor-driven variable resistors to implement the adaptive parameters wj. These are illustrated in Figure 4.8. The inputs were obtained from a simple camera system based on an array of photo-sensors, while the basis functions \u03c6 could be chosen in a variety of ways, for example based on simple \ufb01xed functions of randomly chosen subsets of pixels from the input image. Typical applications involved learning to discriminate simple shapes or characters. At the same time that the perceptron was being developed, a closely related system called the adaline, which is short for \u2018adaptive linear element\u2019, was being explored by Widrow and co-workers. The functional form of the model was the same as for the perceptron, but a different approach to training was adopted (Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Widrow and Lehr, 1990). 4.2.

    "text": "198 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION Note that in (4.57) we have simply rewritten the posterior probabilities in an equivalent form, and so the appearance of the logistic sigmoid may seem rather vac- uous. However, it will have signi\ufb01cance provided a(x) takes a simple functional form. We shall shortly consider situations in which a(x) is a linear function of x, in which case the posterior probability is governed by a generalized linear model. For the case of K > 2 classes, we have p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) \u0005 j p(x|Cj)p(Cj) = exp(ak) \u0005 j exp(aj) (4.62) which is known as the normalized exponential and can be regarded as a multiclass generalization of the logistic sigmoid. Here the quantities ak are de\ufb01ned by ak = ln p(x|Ck)p(Ck). (4.63) The normalized exponential is also known as the softmax function, as it represents a smoothed version of the \u2018max\u2019 function because, if ak \u226baj for all j \u0338= k, then p(Ck|x) \u22431, and p(Cj|x) \u22430. We now investigate the consequences of choosing speci\ufb01c forms for the class- conditional densities, looking \ufb01rst at continuous input variables x and then dis- cussing brie\ufb02y the case of discrete inputs. 4.2.1 Continuous inputs Let us assume that the class-conditional densities are Gaussian and then explore the resulting form for the posterior probabilities. To start with, we shall assume that all classes share the same covariance matrix. Thus the density for class Ck is given by p(x|Ck) = 1 (2\u03c0)D/2 1 |\u03a3|1/2 exp \u22121 2(x \u2212\u00b5k)T\u03a3\u22121(x \u2212\u00b5k) . (4.64) Consider \ufb01rst the case of two classes. From (4.57) and (4.58), we have p(C1|x) = \u03c3(wTx + w0) (4.65) where we have de\ufb01ned w = \u03a3\u22121(\u00b51 \u2212\u00b52) (4.66) w0 = \u22121 2\u00b5T 1 \u03a3\u22121\u00b51 + 1 2\u00b5T 2 \u03a3\u22121\u00b52 + ln p(C1) p(C2). (4.67) We see that the quadratic terms in x from the exponents of the Gaussian densities have cancelled (due to the assumption of common covariance matrices) leading to a linear function of x in the argument of the logistic sigmoid. This result is illus- trated for the case of a two-dimensional input space x in Figure 4.10. The resulting",

The surface in the right-hand plot is coloured using a proportion of red ink given by p(C1|x) and a proportion of blue ink given by p(C2|x) = 1 \u2212p(C1|x). decision boundaries correspond to surfaces along which the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) are constant and so will be given by linear functions of x, and therefore the decision boundaries are linear in input space. The prior probabilities p(Ck) enter only through the bias parameter w0 so that changes in the priors have the effect of making parallel shifts of the decision boundary and more generally of the parallel contours of constant posterior probability. For the general case of K classes we have, from (4.62) and (4.63), ak(x) = wT k x + wk0 (4.68) where we have de\ufb01ned wk = \u03a3\u22121\u00b5k (4.69) wk0 = \u22121 2\u00b5T k \u03a3\u22121\u00b5k + ln p(Ck).

The resulting decision boundaries, corresponding to the minimum misclassi\ufb01cation rate, will occur when two of the posterior probabilities (the two largest) are equal, and so will be de\ufb01ned by linear functions of x, and so again we have a generalized linear model. If we relax the assumption of a shared covariance matrix and allow each class- conditional density p(x|Ck) to have its own covariance matrix \u03a3k, then the earlier cancellations will no longer occur, and we will obtain quadratic functions of x, giv- ing rise to a quadratic discriminant.

This requires a data set comprising observations of x along with their corresponding class labels. Consider \ufb01rst the case of two classes, each having a Gaussian class-conditional density with a shared covariance matrix, and suppose we have a data set {xn, tn} where n = 1, . . . , N. Here tn = 1 denotes class C1 and tn = 0 denotes class C2. We denote the prior class probability p(C1) = \u03c0, so that p(C2) = 1 \u2212\u03c0. For a data point xn from class C1, we have tn = 1 and hence p(xn, C1) = p(C1)p(xn|C1) = \u03c0N(xn|\u00b51, \u03a3). Similarly for class C2, we have tn = 0 and hence p(xn, C2) = p(C2)p(xn|C2) = (1 \u2212\u03c0)N(xn|\u00b52, \u03a3). Thus the likelihood function is given by p(t|\u03c0, \u00b51, \u00b52, \u03a3) = N \u000e n=1 [\u03c0N(xn|\u00b51, \u03a3)]tn [(1 \u2212\u03c0)N(xn|\u00b52, \u03a3)]1\u2212tn (4.71) where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T.

(4.72) Setting the derivative with respect to \u03c0 equal to zero and rearranging, we obtain \u03c0 = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 tn = N1 N = N1 N1 + N2 (4.73) where N1 denotes the total number of data points in class C1, and N2 denotes the total number of data points in class C2. Thus the maximum likelihood estimate for \u03c0 is simply the fraction of points in class C1 as expected. This result is easily generalized to the multiclass case where again the maximum likelihood estimate of the prior probability associated with class Ck is given by the fraction of the training set points assigned to that class. Exercise 4.9 Now consider the maximization with respect to \u00b51. Again we can pick out of the log likelihood function those terms that depend on \u00b51 giving N \u0002 n=1 tn ln N(xn|\u00b51, \u03a3) = \u22121 2 N \u0002 n=1 tn(xn \u2212\u00b51)T\u03a3\u22121(xn \u2212\u00b51) + const.

By a similar argument, the corresponding result for \u00b52 is given by \u00b52 = 1 N2 N \u0002 n=1 (1 \u2212tn)xn (4.76) which again is the mean of all the input vectors xn assigned to class C2.

(4.80) Using the standard result for the maximum likelihood solution for a Gaussian distri- bution, we see that \u03a3 = S, which represents a weighted average of the covariance matrices associated with each of the two classes separately. This result is easily extended to the K class problem to obtain the corresponding maximum likelihood solutions for the parameters in which each class-conditional density is Gaussian with a shared covariance matrix. Note that the approach of \ufb01tting Exercise 4.10 Gaussian distributions to the classes is not robust to outliers, because the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian is not robust. Section 2.3.7 4.2.3 Discrete features Let us now consider the case of discrete feature values xi. For simplicity, we begin by looking at binary feature values xi \u2208{0, 1} and discuss the extension to more general discrete features shortly. If there are D inputs, then a general distribu- tion would correspond to a table of 2D numbers for each class, containing 2D \u22121 independent variables (due to the summation constraint). Because this grows expo- nentially with the number of features, we might seek a more restricted representa- tion. Here we will make the naive Bayes assumption in which the feature values are Section 8.2.2 treated as independent, conditioned on the class Ck. Thus we have class-conditional distributions of the form p(x|Ck) = D \u000e i=1 \u00b5xi ki(1 \u2212\u00b5ki)1\u2212xi (4.81) which contain D independent parameters for each class. Substituting into (4.63) then gives ak(x) = D \u0002 i=1 {xi ln \u00b5ki + (1 \u2212xi) ln(1 \u2212\u00b5ki)} + ln p(Ck) (4.82) which again are linear functions of the input values xi. For the case of K = 2 classes, we can alternatively consider the logistic sigmoid formulation given by (4.57). Anal- ogous results are obtained for discrete variables each of which can take M > 2 states.

These are particular cases of a more general result obtained by assuming that the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck) are members of the exponential family of distributions. Using the form (2.194) for members of the exponential family, we see that the distribution of x can be written in the form p(x|\u03bbk) = h(x)g(\u03bbk) exp \u001a \u03bbT k u(x)\u001b . (4.83) We now restrict attention to the subclass of such distributions for which u(x) = x. Then we make use of (2.236) to introduce a scaling parameter s, so that we obtain the restricted set of exponential family class-conditional densities of the form p(x|\u03bbk, s) = 1 sh \u000f1 sx \u0010 g(\u03bbk) exp 1 s\u03bbT k x . (4.84) Note that we are allowing each class to have its own parameter vector \u03bbk but we are assuming that the classes share the same scale parameter s. For the two-class problem, we substitute this expression for the class-conditional densities into (4.58) and we see that the posterior class probability is again given by a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function a(x) which is given by a(x) = (\u03bb1 \u2212\u03bb2)Tx + ln g(\u03bb1) \u2212ln g(\u03bb2) + ln p(C1) \u2212ln p(C2). (4.85) Similarly, for the K-class problem, we substitute the class-conditional density ex- pression into (4.63) to give ak(x) = \u03bbT k x + ln g(\u03bbk) + ln p(Ck) (4.86) and so again is a linear function of x. 4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models For the two-class classi\ufb01cation problem, we have seen that the posterior probability of class C1 can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of x, for a wide choice of class-conditional distributions p(x|Ck). Similarly, for the multiclass case, the posterior probability of class Ck is given by a softmax transformation of a linear function of x. For speci\ufb01c choices of the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck), we have used maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the densities as well as the class priors p(Ck) and then used Bayes\u2019 theorem to \ufb01nd the posterior class probabilities. However, an alternative approach is to use the functional form of the generalized linear model explicitly and to determine its parameters directly by using maximum likelihood. We shall see that there is an ef\ufb01cient algorithm \ufb01nding such solutions known as iterative reweighted least squares, or IRLS.

The right-hand plot shows the corresponding feature space (\u03c61, \u03c62) together with the linear decision boundary obtained given by a logistic regression model of the form discussed in Section 4.3.2. This corresponds to a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space, shown by the black curve in the left-hand plot. Bayes\u2019 theorem, represents an example of generative modelling, because we could take such a model and generate synthetic data by drawing values of x from the marginal distribution p(x). In the direct approach, we are maximizing a likelihood function de\ufb01ned through the conditional distribution p(Ck|x), which represents a form of discriminative training. One advantage of the discriminative approach is that there will typically be fewer adaptive parameters to be determined, as we shall see shortly. It may also lead to improved predictive performance, particularly when the class-conditional density assumptions give a poor approximation to the true dis- tributions. 4.3.1 Fixed basis functions So far in this chapter, we have considered classi\ufb01cation models that work di- rectly with the original input vector x. However, all of the algorithms are equally applicable if we \ufb01rst make a \ufb01xed nonlinear transformation of the inputs using a vector of basis functions \u03c6(x). The resulting decision boundaries will be linear in the feature space \u03c6, and these correspond to nonlinear decision boundaries in the original x space, as illustrated in Figure 4.12.

For the remainder of this chapter, we shall include a \ufb01xed basis function transformation \u03c6(x), as this will highlight some useful similarities to the regression models discussed in Chapter 3. For many problems of practical interest, there is signi\ufb01cant overlap between the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck). This corresponds to posterior probabilities p(Ck|x), which, for at least some values of x, are not 0 or 1. In such cases, the opti- mal solution is obtained by modelling the posterior probabilities accurately and then applying standard decision theory, as discussed in Chapter 1. Note that nonlinear transformations \u03c6(x) cannot remove such class overlap. Indeed, they can increase the level of overlap, or create overlap where none existed in the original observation space. However, suitable choices of nonlinearity can make the process of modelling the posterior probabilities easier. Such \ufb01xed basis function models have important limitations, and these will be Section 3.6 resolved in later chapters by allowing the basis functions themselves to adapt to the data. Notwithstanding these limitations, models with \ufb01xed nonlinear basis functions play an important role in applications, and a discussion of such models will intro- duce many of the key concepts needed for an understanding of their more complex counterparts. 4.3.2 Logistic regression We begin our treatment of generalized linear models by considering the problem of two-class classi\ufb01cation. In our discussion of generative approaches in Section 4.2, we saw that under rather general assumptions, the posterior probability of class C1 can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of the feature vector \u03c6 so that p(C1|\u03c6) = y(\u03c6) = \u03c3 wT\u03c6 (4.87) with p(C2|\u03c6) = 1 \u2212p(C1|\u03c6). Here \u03c3(\u00b7) is the logistic sigmoid function de\ufb01ned by (4.59). In the terminology of statistics, this model is known as logistic regression, although it should be emphasized that this is a model for classi\ufb01cation rather than regression. For an M-dimensional feature space \u03c6, this model has M adjustable parameters. By contrast, if we had \ufb01tted Gaussian class conditional densities using maximum likelihood, we would have used 2M parameters for the means and M(M + 1)/2 parameters for the (shared) covariance matrix. Together with the class prior p(C1), this gives a total of M(M +5)/2+1 parameters, which grows quadratically with M, in contrast to the linear dependence on M of the number of parameters in logistic regression. For large values of M, there is a clear advantage in working with the logistic regression model directly. We now use maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the logistic regression model. To do this, we shall make use of the derivative of the logistic sig- moid function, which can conveniently be expressed in terms of the sigmoid function itself Exercise 4.12 d\u03c3 da = \u03c3(1 \u2212\u03c3).

We see that the factor involving the derivative of the logistic sigmoid has cancelled, leading to a simpli\ufb01ed form for the gradient of the log likelihood. In particular, the contribution to the gradient from data point n is given by the \u2018error\u2019 yn \u2212tn between the target value and the prediction of the model, times the basis function vector \u03c6n. Furthermore, comparison with (3.13) shows that this takes precisely the same form as the gradient of the sum-of-squares error function for the linear regression model. Section 3.1.1 If desired, we could make use of the result (4.91) to give a sequential algorithm in which patterns are presented one at a time, in which each of the weight vectors is updated using (3.22) in which \u2207En is the nth term in (4.91). It is worth noting that maximum likelihood can exhibit severe over-\ufb01tting for data sets that are linearly separable. This arises because the maximum likelihood so- lution occurs when the hyperplane corresponding to \u03c3 = 0.5, equivalent to wT\u03c6 = 0, separates the two classes and the magnitude of w goes to in\ufb01nity. In this case, the logistic sigmoid function becomes in\ufb01nitely steep in feature space, corresponding to a Heaviside step function, so that every training point from each class k is assigned a posterior probability p(Ck|x) = 1. Furthermore, there is typically a continuum Exercise 4.14 of such solutions because any separating hyperplane will give rise to the same pos- terior probabilities at the training data points, as will be seen later in Figure 10.13. Maximum likelihood provides no way to favour one such solution over another, and which solution is found in practice will depend on the choice of optimization algo- rithm and on the parameter initialization. Note that the problem will arise even if the number of data points is large compared with the number of parameters in the model, so long as the training data set is linearly separable. The singularity can be avoided by inclusion of a prior and \ufb01nding a MAP solution for w, or equivalently by adding a regularization term to the error function.",

Probabilistic Discriminative Models 207 4.3.3 Iterative reweighted least squares In the case of the linear regression models discussed in Chapter 3, the maxi- mum likelihood solution, on the assumption of a Gaussian noise model, leads to a closed-form solution. This was a consequence of the quadratic dependence of the log likelihood function on the parameter vector w. For logistic regression, there is no longer a closed-form solution, due to the nonlinearity of the logistic sigmoid function. However, the departure from a quadratic form is not substantial. To be precise, the error function is concave, as we shall see shortly, and hence has a unique minimum. Furthermore, the error function can be minimized by an ef\ufb01cient iterative technique based on the Newton-Raphson iterative optimization scheme, which uses a local quadratic approximation to the log likelihood function. The Newton-Raphson update, for minimizing a function E(w), takes the form (Fletcher, 1987; Bishop and Nabney, 2008) w(new) = w(old) \u2212H\u22121\u2207E(w). (4.92) where H is the Hessian matrix whose elements comprise the second derivatives of E(w) with respect to the components of w. Let us \ufb01rst of all apply the Newton-Raphson method to the linear regression model (3.3) with the sum-of-squares error function (3.12). The gradient and Hessian of this error function are given by \u2207E(w) = N \u0002 n=1 (wT\u03c6n \u2212tn)\u03c6n = \u03a6T\u03a6w \u2212\u03a6Tt (4.93) H = \u2207\u2207E(w) = N \u0002 n=1 \u03c6n\u03c6T n = \u03a6T\u03a6 (4.94) where \u03a6 is the N \u00d7 M design matrix, whose nth row is given by \u03c6T n. The Newton- Section 3.1.1 Raphson update then takes the form w(new) = w(old) \u2212(\u03a6T\u03a6)\u22121 \u001a \u03a6T\u03a6w(old) \u2212\u03a6Tt\u001b = (\u03a6T\u03a6)\u22121\u03a6Tt (4.95) which we recognize as the standard least-squares solution. Note that the error func- tion in this case is quadratic and hence the Newton-Raphson formula gives the exact solution in one step. Now let us apply the Newton-Raphson update to the cross-entropy error function (4.90) for the logistic regression model. From (4.91) we see that the gradient and Hessian of this error function are given by \u2207E(w) = N \u0002 n=1 (yn \u2212tn)\u03c6n = \u03a6T(y \u2212t) (4.96) H = \u2207\u2207E(w) = N \u0002 n=1 yn(1 \u2212yn)\u03c6n\u03c6T n = \u03a6TR\u03a6 (4.97)",

(4.98) We see that the Hessian is no longer constant but depends on w through the weight- ing matrix R, corresponding to the fact that the error function is no longer quadratic. Using the property 0 < yn < 1, which follows from the form of the logistic sigmoid function, we see that uTHu > 0 for an arbitrary vector u, and so the Hessian matrix H is positive de\ufb01nite. It follows that the error function is a concave function of w and hence has a unique minimum. Exercise 4.15 The Newton-Raphson update formula for the logistic regression model then be- comes w(new) = w(old) \u2212(\u03a6TR\u03a6)\u22121\u03a6T(y \u2212t) = (\u03a6TR\u03a6)\u22121 \u001a \u03a6TR\u03a6w(old) \u2212\u03a6T(y \u2212t)\u001b = (\u03a6TR\u03a6)\u22121\u03a6TRz (4.99) where z is an N-dimensional vector with elements z = \u03a6w(old) \u2212R\u22121(y \u2212t). (4.100) We see that the update formula (4.99) takes the form of a set of normal equations for a weighted least-squares problem. Because the weighing matrix R is not constant but depends on the parameter vector w, we must apply the normal equations iteratively, each time using the new weight vector w to compute a revised weighing matrix R. For this reason, the algorithm is known as iterative reweighted least squares, or IRLS (Rubin, 1983). As in the weighted least-squares problem, the elements of the diagonal weighting matrix R can be interpreted as variances because the mean and variance of t in the logistic regression model are given by E[t] = \u03c3(x) = y (4.101) var[t] = E[t2] \u2212E[t]2 = \u03c3(x) \u2212\u03c3(x)2 = y(1 \u2212y) (4.102) where we have used the property t2 = t for t \u2208{0, 1}. In fact, we can interpret IRLS as the solution to a linearized problem in the space of the variable a = wT\u03c6. The quantity zn, which corresponds to the nth element of z, can then be given a simple interpretation as an effective target value in this space obtained by making a local linear approximation to the logistic sigmoid function around the current operating point w(old) an(w) \u2243 an(w(old)) + dan dyn \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 w(old) (tn \u2212yn) = \u03c6T nw(old) \u2212(yn \u2212tn) yn(1 \u2212yn) = zn.

Probabilistic Discriminative Models 209 4.3.4 Multiclass logistic regression In our discussion of generative models for multiclass classi\ufb01cation, we have Section 4.2 seen that for a large class of distributions, the posterior probabilities are given by a softmax transformation of linear functions of the feature variables, so that p(Ck|\u03c6) = yk(\u03c6) = exp(ak) \u0005 j exp(aj) (4.104) where the \u2018activations\u2019 ak are given by ak = wT k \u03c6. (4.105) There we used maximum likelihood to determine separately the class-conditional densities and the class priors and then found the corresponding posterior probabilities using Bayes\u2019 theorem, thereby implicitly determining the parameters {wk}. Here we consider the use of maximum likelihood to determine the parameters {wk} of this model directly. To do this, we will require the derivatives of yk with respect to all of the activations aj. These are given by Exercise 4.17 \u2202yk \u2202aj = yk(Ikj \u2212yj) (4.106) where Ikj are the elements of the identity matrix. Next we write down the likelihood function. This is most easily done using the 1-of-K coding scheme in which the target vector tn for a feature vector \u03c6n belonging to class Ck is a binary vector with all elements zero except for element k, which equals one. The likelihood function is then given by p(T|w1, . . . , wK) = N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 p(Ck|\u03c6n)tnk = N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 ytnk nk (4.107) where ynk = yk(\u03c6n), and T is an N \u00d7 K matrix of target variables with elements tnk.

Once again, we see the same form arising for the gradient as was found for the sum-of-squares error function with the linear model and the cross-entropy error for the logistic regression model, namely the prod- uct of the error (ynj \u2212tnj) times the basis function \u03c6n. Again, we could use this to formulate a sequential algorithm in which patterns are presented one at a time, in which each of the weight vectors is updated using (3.22). We have seen that the derivative of the log likelihood function for a linear regres- sion model with respect to the parameter vector w for a data point n took the form of the \u2018error\u2019 yn \u2212tn times the feature vector \u03c6n. Similarly, for the combination of logistic sigmoid activation function and cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108), we again obtain this same simple form. This is an example of a more general result, as we shall see in Section 4.3.6. To \ufb01nd a batch algorithm, we again appeal to the Newton-Raphson update to obtain the corresponding IRLS algorithm for the multiclass problem. This requires evaluation of the Hessian matrix that comprises blocks of size M \u00d7 M in which block j, k is given by \u2207wk\u2207wjE(w1, . . . , wK) = \u2212 N \u0002 n=1 ynk(Ikj \u2212ynj)\u03c6n\u03c6T n.

Exercise 4.20 Practical details of IRLS for the multiclass case can be found in Bishop and Nabney (2008). 4.3.5 Probit regression We have seen that, for a broad range of class-conditional distributions, described by the exponential family, the resulting posterior class probabilities are given by a logistic (or softmax) transformation acting on a linear function of the feature vari- ables. However, not all choices of class-conditional density give rise to such a simple form for the posterior probabilities (for instance, if the class-conditional densities are modelled using Gaussian mixtures). This suggests that it might be worth exploring other types of discriminative probabilistic model. For the purposes of this chapter, however, we shall return to the two-class case, and again remain within the frame- work of generalized linear models so that p(t = 1|a) = f(a) (4.111) where a = wT\u03c6, and f(\u00b7) is the activation function. One way to motivate an alternative choice for the link function is to consider a noisy threshold model, as follows. For each input \u03c6n, we evaluate an = wT\u03c6n and then we set the target value according to tn = 1 if an \u2a7e\u03b8 tn = 0 otherwise. (4.112)",

Conversely, the value of the red curve at this point corresponds to the area under the blue curve indicated by the shaded green region. In the stochastic threshold model, the class label takes the value t = 1 if the value of a = wT\u03c6 exceeds a threshold, oth- erwise it takes the value t = 0.

One issue that can occur in practical applications is that of outliers, which can arise for instance through errors in measuring the input vector x or through misla- belling of the target value t. Because such points can lie a long way to the wrong side of the ideal decision boundary, they can seriously distort the classi\ufb01er. Note that the logistic and probit regression models behave differently in this respect because the tails of the logistic sigmoid decay asymptotically like exp(\u2212x) for x \u2192\u221e, whereas for the probit activation function they decay like exp(\u2212x2), and so the probit model can be signi\ufb01cantly more sensitive to outliers. However, both the logistic and the probit models assume the data is correctly labelled. The effect of mislabelling is easily incorporated into a probabilistic model by introducing a probability \u03f5 that the target value t has been \ufb02ipped to the wrong value (Opper and Winther, 2000a), leading to a target value distribution for data point x of the form p(t|x) = (1 \u2212\u03f5)\u03c3(x) + \u03f5(1 \u2212\u03c3(x)) = \u03f5 + (1 \u22122\u03f5)\u03c3(x) (4.117) where \u03c3(x) is the activation function with input vector x. Here \u03f5 may be set in advance, or it may be treated as a hyperparameter whose value is inferred from the data. 4.3.6 Canonical link functions For the linear regression model with a Gaussian noise distribution, the error function, corresponding to the negative log likelihood, is given by (3.12). If we take the derivative with respect to the parameter vector w of the contribution to the error function from a data point n, this takes the form of the \u2018error\u2019 yn \u2212tn times the feature vector \u03c6n, where yn = wT\u03c6n. Similarly, for the combination of the logistic sigmoid activation function and the cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108), we again obtain this same simple form. We now show that this is a general result of assuming a conditional distribution for the target variable from the exponential family, along with a corresponding choice for the activation function known as the canonical link function. We again make use of the restricted form (4.84) of exponential family distribu- tions. Note that here we are applying the assumption of exponential family distribu- tion to the target variable t, in contrast to Section 4.2.4 where we applied it to the input vector x. We therefore consider conditional distributions of the target variable of the form p(t|\u03b7, s) = 1 sh \u0011 t s \u0012 g(\u03b7) exp \u0013\u03b7t s \u0014 . (4.118) Using the same line of argument as led to the derivation of the result (2.226), we see that the conditional mean of t, which we denote by y, is given by y \u2261E[t|\u03b7] = \u2212s d d\u03b7 ln g(\u03b7).

It is therefore necessary to introduce some form of approximation. Later in the book we shall consider a range of techniques based on analytical approximations Chapter 10 and numerical sampling. Chapter 11 Here we introduce a simple, but widely used, framework called the Laplace ap- proximation, that aims to \ufb01nd a Gaussian approximation to a probability density de\ufb01ned over a set of continuous variables. Consider \ufb01rst the case of a single contin- uous variable z, and suppose the distribution p(z) is de\ufb01ned by p(z) = 1 Z f(z) (4.125) where Z = f(z) dz is the normalization coef\ufb01cient. We shall suppose that the value of Z is unknown. In the Laplace method the goal is to \ufb01nd a Gaussian approx- imation q(z) which is centred on a mode of the distribution p(z). The \ufb01rst step is to \ufb01nd a mode of p(z), in other words a point z0 such that p\u2032(z0) = 0, or equivalently df(z) dz \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 z=z0 = 0.

Taking the exponential we obtain f(z) \u2243f(z0) exp \u2212A 2 (z \u2212z0)2 . (4.129) We can then obtain a normalized distribution q(z) by making use of the standard result for the normalization of a Gaussian, so that q(z) = \u000f A 2\u03c0 \u00101/2 exp \u2212A 2 (z \u2212z0)2 . (4.130) The Laplace approximation is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Note that the Gaussian approximation will only be well de\ufb01ned if its precision A > 0, in other words the stationary point z0 must be a local maximum, so that the second derivative of f(z) at the point z0 is negative.",

(4.133) The distribution q(z) is proportional to f(z) and the appropriate normalization coef- \ufb01cient can be found by inspection, using the standard result (2.43) for a normalized multivariate Gaussian, giving q(z) = |A|1/2 (2\u03c0)M/2 exp \u22121 2(z \u2212z0)TA(z \u2212z0) = N(z|z0, A\u22121) (4.134) where |A| denotes the determinant of A. This Gaussian distribution will be well de\ufb01ned provided its precision matrix, given by A, is positive de\ufb01nite, which implies that the stationary point z0 must be a local maximum, not a minimum or a saddle point. In order to apply the Laplace approximation we \ufb01rst need to \ufb01nd the mode z0, and then evaluate the Hessian matrix at that mode. In practice a mode will typi- cally be found by running some form of numerical optimization algorithm (Bishop",

    "text": "216 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION and Nabney, 2008). Many of the distributions encountered in practice will be mul- timodal and so there will be different Laplace approximations according to which mode is being considered. Note that the normalization constant Z of the true distri- bution does not need to be known in order to apply the Laplace method. As a result of the central limit theorem, the posterior distribution for a model is expected to become increasingly better approximated by a Gaussian as the number of observed data points is increased, and so we would expect the Laplace approximation to be most useful in situations where the number of data points is relatively large. One major weakness of the Laplace approximation is that, since it is based on a Gaussian distribution, it is only directly applicable to real variables. In other cases it may be possible to apply the Laplace approximation to a transformation of the variable. For instance if 0 \u2a7d\u03c4 < \u221ethen we can consider a Laplace approximation of ln \u03c4. The most serious limitation of the Laplace framework, however, is that it is based purely on the aspects of the true distribution at a speci\ufb01c value of the variable, and so can fail to capture important global properties. In Chapter 10 we shall consider alternative approaches which adopt a more global perspective. 4.4.1 Model comparison and BIC As well as approximating the distribution p(z) we can also obtain an approxi- mation to the normalization constant Z. Using the approximation (4.133) we have Z = \u0006 f(z) dz \u2243 f(z0) \u0006 exp \u22121 2(z \u2212z0)TA(z \u2212z0) dz = f(z0)(2\u03c0)M/2 |A|1/2 (4.135) where we have noted that the integrand is Gaussian and made use of the standard result (2.43) for a normalized Gaussian distribution. We can use the result (4.135) to obtain an approximation to the model evidence which, as discussed in Section 3.4, plays a central role in Bayesian model comparison. Consider a data set D and a set of models {Mi} having parameters {\u03b8i}. For each model we de\ufb01ne a likelihood function p(D|\u03b8i, Mi). If we introduce a prior p(\u03b8i|Mi) over the parameters, then we are interested in computing the model evi- dence p(D|Mi) for the various models. From now on we omit the conditioning on Mi to keep the notation uncluttered. From Bayes\u2019 theorem the model evidence is given by p(D) = \u0006 p(D|\u03b8)p(\u03b8) d\u03b8. (4.136) Identifying f(\u03b8) = p(D|\u03b8)p(\u03b8) and Z = p(D), and applying the result (4.135), we obtain Exercise 4.22 ln p(D) \u2243ln p(D|\u03b8MAP) + ln p(\u03b8MAP) + M 2 ln(2\u03c0) \u22121 2 ln |A| ( )* + Occam factor (4.137)",

If we assume that the Gaussian prior distribution over parameters is broad, and that the Hessian has full rank, then we can approximate (4.137) very roughly using Exercise 4.23 ln p(D) \u2243ln p(D|\u03b8MAP) \u22121 2M ln N (4.139) where N is the number of data points, M is the number of parameters in \u03b8 and we have omitted additive constants. This is known as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Schwarz criterion (Schwarz, 1978). Note that, compared to AIC given by (1.73), this penalizes model complexity more heavily. Complexity measures such as AIC and BIC have the virtue of being easy to evaluate, but can also give misleading results. In particular, the assumption that the Hessian matrix has full rank is often not valid since many of the parameters are not \u2018well-determined\u2019. We can use the result (4.137) to obtain a more accurate estimate Section 3.5.3 of the model evidence starting from the Laplace approximation, as we illustrate in the context of neural networks in Section 5.7. 4.5. Bayesian Logistic Regression We now turn to a Bayesian treatment of logistic regression. Exact Bayesian infer- ence for logistic regression is intractable. In particular, evaluation of the posterior distribution would require normalization of the product of a prior distribution and a likelihood function that itself comprises a product of logistic sigmoid functions, one for every data point. Evaluation of the predictive distribution is similarly intractable. Here we consider the application of the Laplace approximation to the problem of Bayesian logistic regression (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990; MacKay, 1992b). 4.5.1 Laplace approximation Recall from Section 4.4 that the Laplace approximation is obtained by \ufb01nding the mode of the posterior distribution and then \ufb01tting a Gaussian centred at that mode. This requires evaluation of the second derivatives of the log posterior, which is equivalent to \ufb01nding the Hessian matrix. Because we seek a Gaussian representation for the posterior distribution, it is natural to begin with a Gaussian prior, which we write in the general form p(w) = N(w|m0, S0) (4.140)",

The posterior distribution over w is given by p(w|t) \u221dp(w)p(t|w) (4.141) where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. Taking the log of both sides, and substituting for the prior distribution using (4.140), and for the likelihood function using (4.89), we obtain ln p(w|t) = \u22121 2(w \u2212m0)TS\u22121 0 (w \u2212m0) + N \u0002 n=1 {tn ln yn + (1 \u2212tn) ln(1 \u2212yn)} + const (4.142) where yn = \u03c3(wT\u03c6n). To obtain a Gaussian approximation to the posterior dis- tribution, we \ufb01rst maximize the posterior distribution to give the MAP (maximum posterior) solution wMAP, which de\ufb01nes the mean of the Gaussian. The covariance is then given by the inverse of the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log likelihood, which takes the form SN = \u2212\u2207\u2207ln p(w|t) = S\u22121 0 + N \u0002 n=1 yn(1 \u2212yn)\u03c6n\u03c6T n. (4.143) The Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution therefore takes the form q(w) = N(w|wMAP, SN). (4.144) Having obtained a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution, there remains the task of marginalizing with respect to this distribution in order to make predictions. 4.5.2 Predictive distribution The predictive distribution for class C1, given a new feature vector \u03c6(x), is obtained by marginalizing with respect to the posterior distribution p(w|t), which is itself approximated by a Gaussian distribution q(w) so that p(C1|\u03c6, t) = \u0006 p(C1|\u03c6, w)p(w|t) dw \u2243 \u0006 \u03c3(wT\u03c6)q(w) dw (4.145) with the corresponding probability for class C2 given by p(C2|\u03c6, t) = 1\u2212p(C1|\u03c6, t). To evaluate the predictive distribution, we \ufb01rst note that the function \u03c3(wT\u03c6) de- pends on w only through its projection onto \u03c6. Denoting a = wT\u03c6, we have \u03c3(wT\u03c6) = \u0006 \u03b4(a \u2212wT\u03c6)\u03c3(a) da (4.146) where \u03b4(\u00b7) is the Dirac delta function. From this we obtain \u0006 \u03c3(wT\u03c6)q(w) dw = \u0006 \u03c3(a)p(a) da (4.147)",

Because q(w) is Gaussian, we know from Section 2.3.2 that the marginal distribution will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate the mean and covariance of this distribution by taking moments, and interchanging the order of integration over a and w, so that \u00b5a = E[a] = \u0006 p(a)a da = \u0006 q(w)wT\u03c6 dw = wT MAP\u03c6 (4.149) where we have used the result (4.144) for the variational posterior distribution q(w).

Exercise 4.24 The integral over a represents the convolution of a Gaussian with a logistic sig- moid, and cannot be evaluated analytically. We can, however, obtain a good approx- imation (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990; MacKay, 1992b; Barber and Bishop, 1998a) by making use of the close similarity between the logistic sigmoid function \u03c3(a) de\ufb01ned by (4.59) and the probit function \u03a6(a) de\ufb01ned by (4.114). In order to obtain the best approximation to the logistic function we need to re-scale the hori- zontal axis, so that we approximate \u03c3(a) by \u03a6(\u03bba). We can \ufb01nd a suitable value of \u03bb by requiring that the two functions have the same slope at the origin, which gives \u03bb2 = \u03c0/8. The similarity of the logistic sigmoid and the probit function, for this Exercise 4.25 choice of \u03bb, is illustrated in Figure 4.9. The advantage of using a probit function is that its convolution with a Gaussian can be expressed analytically in terms of another probit function. Speci\ufb01cally we can show that Exercise 4.26 \u0006 \u03a6(\u03bba)N(a|\u00b5, \u03c32) da = \u03a6 \u000f \u00b5 (\u03bb\u22122 + \u03c32)1/2 \u0010 . (4.152)",

One advantage of SVMs is that, although the training involves nonlinear optimization, the objective function is convex, and so the solution of the optimization problem is relatively straightforward. The number of basis functions in the resulting models is generally much smaller than the number of training points, although it is often still relatively large and typically increases with the size of the training set. The relevance vector machine, discussed in Section 7.2, also chooses a subset from a \ufb01xed set of basis functions and typically results in much 225",

An alternative approach is to \ufb01x the number of basis functions in advance but allow them to be adaptive, in other words to use parametric forms for the basis func- tions in which the parameter values are adapted during training. The most successful model of this type in the context of pattern recognition is the feed-forward neural network, also known as the multilayer perceptron, discussed in this chapter. In fact, \u2018multilayer perceptron\u2019 is really a misnomer, because the model comprises multi- ple layers of logistic regression models (with continuous nonlinearities) rather than multiple perceptrons (with discontinuous nonlinearities). For many applications, the resulting model can be signi\ufb01cantly more compact, and hence faster to evaluate, than a support vector machine having the same generalization performance. The price to be paid for this compactness, as with the relevance vector machine, is that the like- lihood function, which forms the basis for network training, is no longer a convex function of the model parameters. In practice, however, it is often worth investing substantial computational resources during the training phase in order to obtain a compact model that is fast at processing new data. The term \u2018neural network\u2019 has its origins in attempts to \ufb01nd mathematical rep- resentations of information processing in biological systems (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart et al., 1986). Indeed, it has been used very broadly to cover a wide range of different models, many of which have been the subject of exaggerated claims regarding their biological plau- sibility. From the perspective of practical applications of pattern recognition, how- ever, biological realism would impose entirely unnecessary constraints. Our focus in this chapter is therefore on neural networks as ef\ufb01cient models for statistical pattern recognition. In particular, we shall restrict our attention to the speci\ufb01c class of neu- ral networks that have proven to be of greatest practical value, namely the multilayer perceptron. We begin by considering the functional form of the network model, including the speci\ufb01c parameterization of the basis functions, and we then discuss the prob- lem of determining the network parameters within a maximum likelihood frame- work, which involves the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This requires the evaluation of derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the net- work parameters, and we shall see how these can be obtained ef\ufb01ciently using the technique of error backpropagation. We shall also show how the backpropagation framework can be extended to allow other derivatives to be evaluated, such as the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. Next we discuss various approaches to regulariza- tion of neural network training and the relationships between them. We also consider some extensions to the neural network model, and in particular we describe a gen- eral framework for modelling conditional probability distributions known as mixture density networks. Finally, we discuss the use of Bayesian treatments of neural net- works. Additional background on neural network models can be found in Bishop (1995a).",

Feed-forward Network Functions The linear models for regression and classi\ufb01cation discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, re- spectively, are based on linear combinations of \ufb01xed nonlinear basis functions \u03c6j(x) and take the form y(x, w) = f \u0016 M \u0002 j=1 wj\u03c6j(x) \u0017 (5.1) where f(\u00b7) is a nonlinear activation function in the case of classi\ufb01cation and is the identity in the case of regression. Our goal is to extend this model by making the basis functions \u03c6j(x) depend on parameters and then to allow these parameters to be adjusted, along with the coef\ufb01cients {wj}, during training. There are, of course, many ways to construct parametric nonlinear basis functions. Neural networks use basis functions that follow the same form as (5.1), so that each basis function is itself a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the inputs, where the coef\ufb01cients in the linear combination are adaptive parameters. This leads to the basic neural network model, which can be described a series of functional transformations. First we construct M linear combinations of the input variables x1, . . . , xD in the form aj = D \u0002 i=1 w(1) ji xi + w(1) j0 (5.2) where j = 1, . . . , M, and the superscript (1) indicates that the corresponding param- eters are in the \ufb01rst \u2018layer\u2019 of the network. We shall refer to the parameters w(1) ji as weights and the parameters w(1) j0 as biases, following the nomenclature of Chapter 3. The quantities aj are known as activations. Each of them is then transformed using a differentiable, nonlinear activation function h(\u00b7) to give zj = h(aj). (5.3) These quantities correspond to the outputs of the basis functions in (5.1) that, in the context of neural networks, are called hidden units. The nonlinear functions h(\u00b7) are generally chosen to be sigmoidal functions such as the logistic sigmoid or the \u2018tanh\u2019 function. Following (5.1), these values are again linearly combined to give output Exercise 5.1 unit activations ak = M \u0002 j=1 w(2) kj zj + w(2) k0 (5.4) where k = 1, . . . , K, and K is the total number of outputs. This transformation cor- responds to the second layer of the network, and again the w(2) k0 are bias parameters. Finally, the output unit activations are transformed using an appropriate activation function to give a set of network outputs yk. The choice of activation function is determined by the nature of the data and the assumed distribution of target variables",

Thus for standard regression problems, the activation function is the identity so that yk = ak. Similarly, for multiple binary classi\ufb01cation problems, each output unit activation is transformed using a logistic sigmoid function so that yk = \u03c3(ak) (5.5) where \u03c3(a) = 1 1 + exp(\u2212a). (5.6) Finally, for multiclass problems, a softmax activation function of the form (4.62) is used. The choice of output unit activation function is discussed in detail in Sec- tion 5.2. We can combine these various stages to give the overall network function that, for sigmoidal output unit activation functions, takes the form yk(x, w) = \u03c3 \u0016 M \u0002 j=1 w(2) kj h \u0016 D \u0002 i=1 w(1) ji xi + w(1) j0 \u0017 + w(2) k0 \u0017 (5.7) where the set of all weight and bias parameters have been grouped together into a vector w. Thus the neural network model is simply a nonlinear function from a set of input variables {xi} to a set of output variables {yk} controlled by a vector w of adjustable parameters. This function can be represented in the form of a network diagram as shown in Figure 5.1. The process of evaluating (5.7) can then be interpreted as a forward propagation of information through the network. It should be emphasized that these diagrams do not represent probabilistic graphical models of the kind to be consid- ered in Chapter 8 because the internal nodes represent deterministic variables rather than stochastic ones.

As discussed in Section 3.1, the bias parameters in (5.2) can be absorbed into the set of weight parameters by de\ufb01ning an additional input variable x0 whose value is clamped at x0 = 1, so that (5.2) takes the form aj = D \u0002 i=0 w(1) ji xi. (5.8) We can similarly absorb the second-layer biases into the second-layer weights, so that the overall network function becomes yk(x, w) = \u03c3 \u0016 M \u0002 j=0 w(2) kj h \u0016 D \u0002 i=0 w(1) ji xi \u0017\u0017 . (5.9) As can be seen from Figure 5.1, the neural network model comprises two stages of processing, each of which resembles the perceptron model of Section 4.1.7, and for this reason the neural network is also known as the multilayer perceptron, or MLP. A key difference compared to the perceptron, however, is that the neural net- work uses continuous sigmoidal nonlinearities in the hidden units, whereas the per- ceptron uses step-function nonlinearities. This means that the neural network func- tion is differentiable with respect to the network parameters, and this property will play a central role in network training. If the activation functions of all the hidden units in a network are taken to be linear, then for any such network we can always \ufb01nd an equivalent network without hidden units. This follows from the fact that the composition of successive linear transformations is itself a linear transformation. However, if the number of hidden units is smaller than either the number of input or output units, then the transforma- tions that the network can generate are not the most general possible linear trans- formations from inputs to outputs because information is lost in the dimensionality reduction at the hidden units. In Section 12.4.2, we show that networks of linear units give rise to principal component analysis. In general, however, there is little interest in multilayer networks of linear units. The network architecture shown in Figure 5.1 is the most commonly used one in practice. However, it is easily generalized, for instance by considering additional layers of processing each consisting of a weighted linear combination of the form (5.4) followed by an element-wise transformation using a nonlinear activation func- tion. Note that there is some confusion in the literature regarding the terminology for counting the number of layers in such networks. Thus the network in Figure 5.1 may be described as a 3-layer network (which counts the number of layers of units, and treats the inputs as units) or sometimes as a single-hidden-layer network (which counts the number of layers of hidden units). We recommend a terminology in which Figure 5.1 is called a two-layer network, because it is the number of layers of adap- tive weights that is important for determining the network properties. Another generalization of the network architecture is to include skip-layer con- nections, each of which is associated with a corresponding adaptive parameter. For",

Note that each hidden and output unit has an associated bias parameter (omitted for clarity). x1 x2 z1 z3 z2 y1 y2 inputs outputs instance, in a two-layer network these would go directly from inputs to outputs. In principle, a network with sigmoidal hidden units can always mimic skip layer con- nections (for bounded input values) by using a suf\ufb01ciently small \ufb01rst-layer weight that, over its operating range, the hidden unit is effectively linear, and then com- pensating with a large weight value from the hidden unit to the output. In practice, however, it may be advantageous to include skip-layer connections explicitly. Furthermore, the network can be sparse, with not all possible connections within a layer being present. We shall see an example of a sparse network architecture when we consider convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6. Because there is a direct correspondence between a network diagram and its mathematical function, we can develop more general network mappings by con- sidering more complex network diagrams. However, these must be restricted to a feed-forward architecture, in other words to one having no closed directed cycles, to ensure that the outputs are deterministic functions of the inputs. This is illustrated with a simple example in Figure 5.2. Each (hidden or output) unit in such a network computes a function given by zk = h \u0016\u0002 j wkjzj \u0017 (5.10) where the sum runs over all units that send connections to unit k (and a bias param- eter is included in the summation). For a given set of values applied to the inputs of the network, successive application of (5.10) allows the activations of all units in the network to be evaluated including those of the output units. The approximation properties of feed-forward networks have been widely stud- ied (Funahashi, 1989; Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Stinchecombe and White, 1989; Cotter, 1990; Ito, 1991; Hornik, 1991; Kreinovich, 1991; Ripley, 1996) and found to be very general. Neural networks are therefore said to be universal ap- proximators. For example, a two-layer network with linear outputs can uniformly approximate any continuous function on a compact input domain to arbitrary accu- racy provided the network has a suf\ufb01ciently large number of hidden units. This result holds for a wide range of hidden unit activation functions, but excluding polynomi- als. Although such theorems are reassuring, the key problem is how to \ufb01nd suitable parameter values given a set of training data, and in later sections of this chapter we",

In each case, N = 50 data points, shown as blue dots, have been sam- pled uniformly in x over the interval (\u22121, 1) and the corresponding val- ues of f(x) evaluated. These data points are then used to train a two- layer network having 3 hidden units with \u2018tanh\u2019 activation functions and linear output units. The resulting network functions are shown by the red curves, and the outputs of the three hidden units are shown by the three dashed curves. (a) (b) (c) (d) will show that there exist effective solutions to this problem based on both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. The capability of a two-layer network to model a broad range of functions is illustrated in Figure 5.3. This \ufb01gure also shows how individual hidden units work collaboratively to approximate the \ufb01nal function. The role of hidden units in a simple classi\ufb01cation problem is illustrated in Figure 5.4 using the synthetic classi\ufb01cation data set described in Appendix A. 5.1.1 Weight-space symmetries One property of feed-forward networks, which will play a role when we consider Bayesian model comparison, is that multiple distinct choices for the weight vector w can all give rise to the same mapping function from inputs to outputs (Chen et al., 1993). Consider a two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 5.1 with M hidden units having \u2018tanh\u2019 activation functions and full connectivity in both layers. If we change the sign of all of the weights and the bias feeding into a particular hidden unit, then, for a given input pattern, the sign of the activation of the hidden unit will be reversed, because \u2018tanh\u2019 is an odd function, so that tanh(\u2212a) = \u2212tanh(a). This transformation can be exactly compensated by changing the sign of all of the weights leading out of that hidden unit. Thus, by changing the signs of a particular group of weights (and a bias), the input\u2013output mapping function represented by the network is unchanged, and so we have found two different weight vectors that give rise to the same mapping function.

Similarly, imagine that we interchange the values of all of the weights (and the bias) leading both into and out of a particular hidden unit with the corresponding values of the weights (and bias) associated with a different hidden unit. Again, this clearly leaves the network input\u2013output mapping function unchanged, but it corre- sponds to a different choice of weight vector. For M hidden units, any given weight vector will belong to a set of M! equivalent weight vectors associated with this inter- change symmetry, corresponding to the M! different orderings of the hidden units. The network will therefore have an overall weight-space symmetry factor of M!2M. For networks with more than two layers of weights, the total level of symmetry will be given by the product of such factors, one for each layer of hidden units. It turns out that these factors account for all of the symmetries in weight space (except for possible accidental symmetries due to speci\ufb01c choices for the weight val- ues). Furthermore, the existence of these symmetries is not a particular property of the \u2018tanh\u2019 function but applies to a wide range of activation functions (K\u02d9urkov\u00b4a and Kainen, 1994).

Network Training So far, we have viewed neural networks as a general class of parametric nonlinear functions from a vector x of input variables to a vector y of output variables. A simple approach to the problem of determining the network parameters is to make an analogy with the discussion of polynomial curve \ufb01tting in Section 1.1, and therefore to minimize a sum-of-squares error function.

(5.11) However, we can provide a much more general view of network training by \ufb01rst giving a probabilistic interpretation to the network outputs. We have already seen many advantages of using probabilistic predictions in Section 1.5.4. Here it will also provide us with a clearer motivation both for the choice of output unit nonlinearity and the choice of error function. We start by discussing regression problems, and for the moment we consider a single target variable t that can take any real value. Following the discussions in Section 1.2.5 and 3.1, we assume that t has a Gaussian distribution with an x- dependent mean, which is given by the output of the neural network, so that p(t|x, w) = N t|y(x, w), \u03b2\u22121 (5.12) where \u03b2 is the precision (inverse variance) of the Gaussian noise. Of course this is a somewhat restrictive assumption, and in Section 5.6 we shall see how to extend this approach to allow for more general conditional distributions. For the conditional distribution given by (5.12), it is suf\ufb01cient to take the output unit activation function to be the identity, because such a network can approximate any continuous function from x to y. Given a data set of N independent, identically distributed observations X = {x1, . . . , xN}, along with corresponding target values t = {t1, . . . , tN}, we can construct the corresponding likelihood function p(t|X, w, \u03b2) = N \u000e n=1 p(tn|xn, w, \u03b2). Taking the negative logarithm, we obtain the error function \u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, w) \u2212tn}2 \u2212N 2 ln \u03b2 + N 2 ln(2\u03c0) (5.13) which can be used to learn the parameters w and \u03b2. In Section 5.7, we shall dis- cuss the Bayesian treatment of neural networks, while here we consider a maximum likelihood approach. Note that in the neural networks literature, it is usual to con- sider the minimization of an error function rather than the maximization of the (log) likelihood, and so here we shall follow this convention. Consider \ufb01rst the determi- nation of w. Maximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to minimizing the sum-of-squares error function given by E(w) = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, w) \u2212tn}2 (5.14)",

The value of w found by minimizing E(w) will be denoted wML because it corresponds to the maximum likelihood solution. In practice, the nonlinearity of the network function y(xn, w) causes the error E(w) to be nonconvex, and so in practice local maxima of the likelihood may be found, corresponding to local minima of the error function, as discussed in Section 5.2.1. Having found wML, the value of \u03b2 can be found by minimizing the negative log likelihood to give 1 \u03b2ML = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, wML) \u2212tn}2. (5.15) Note that this can be evaluated once the iterative optimization required to \ufb01nd wML is completed. If we have multiple target variables, and we assume that they are inde- pendent conditional on x and w with shared noise precision \u03b2, then the conditional distribution of the target values is given by p(t|x, w) = N t|y(x, w), \u03b2\u22121I . (5.16) Following the same argument as for a single target variable, we see that the maximum likelihood weights are determined by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function (5.11). The noise precision is then given by Exercise 5.2 1 \u03b2ML = 1 NK N \u0002 n=1 \u2225y(xn, wML) \u2212tn\u22252 (5.17) where K is the number of target variables. The assumption of independence can be dropped at the expense of a slightly more complex optimization problem. Exercise 5.3 Recall from Section 4.3.6 that there is a natural pairing of the error function (given by the negative log likelihood) and the output unit activation function. In the regression case, we can view the network as having an output activation function that is the identity, so that yk = ak. The corresponding sum-of-squares error function has the property \u2202E \u2202ak = yk \u2212tk (5.18) which we shall make use of when discussing error backpropagation in Section 5.3. Now consider the case of binary classi\ufb01cation in which we have a single target variable t such that t = 1 denotes class C1 and t = 0 denotes class C2. Following the discussion of canonical link functions in Section 4.3.6, we consider a network having a single output whose activation function is a logistic sigmoid y = \u03c3(a) \u2261 1 1 + exp(\u2212a) (5.19) so that 0 \u2a7dy(x, w) \u2a7d1. We can interpret y(x, w) as the conditional probability p(C1|x), with p(C2|x) given by 1 \u2212y(x, w). The conditional distribution of targets given inputs is then a Bernoulli distribution of the form p(t|x, w) = y(x, w)t {1 \u2212y(x, w)}1\u2212t . (5.20)",

Note that there is no analogue of the noise precision \u03b2 because the target values are assumed to be correctly labelled. However, the model is easily extended to allow for labelling errors. Simard et al. (2003) found that using Exercise 5.4 the cross-entropy error function instead of the sum-of-squares for a classi\ufb01cation problem leads to faster training as well as improved generalization. If we have K separate binary classi\ufb01cations to perform, then we can use a net- work having K outputs each of which has a logistic sigmoid activation function. Associated with each output is a binary class label tk \u2208{0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K. If we assume that the class labels are independent, given the input vector, then the conditional distribution of the targets is p(t|x, w) = K \u000e k=1 yk(x, w)tk [1 \u2212yk(x, w)]1\u2212tk .

Again, the derivative of the error function with re- spect to the activation for a particular output unit takes the form (5.18) just as in the Exercise 5.6 regression case. It is interesting to contrast the neural network solution to this problem with the corresponding approach based on a linear classi\ufb01cation model of the kind discussed in Chapter 4. Suppose that we are using a standard two-layer network of the kind shown in Figure 5.1. We see that the weight parameters in the \ufb01rst layer of the network are shared between the various outputs, whereas in the linear model each classi\ufb01cation problem is solved independently. The \ufb01rst layer of the network can be viewed as performing a nonlinear feature extraction, and the sharing of features between the different outputs can save on computation and can also lead to improved generalization. Finally, we consider the standard multiclass classi\ufb01cation problem in which each input is assigned to one of K mutually exclusive classes. The binary target variables tk \u2208{0, 1} have a 1-of-K coding scheme indicating the class, and the network outputs are interpreted as yk(x, w) = p(tk = 1|x), leading to the following error function E(w) = \u2212 N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 tkn ln yk(xn, w).

For re- gression we use linear outputs and a sum-of-squares error, for (multiple independent) binary classi\ufb01cations we use logistic sigmoid outputs and a cross-entropy error func- tion, and for multiclass classi\ufb01cation we use softmax outputs with the corresponding multiclass cross-entropy error function. For classi\ufb01cation problems involving two classes, we can use a single logistic sigmoid output, or alternatively we can use a network with two outputs having a softmax output activation function. 5.2.1 Parameter optimization We turn next to the task of \ufb01nding a weight vector w which minimizes the chosen function E(w). At this point, it is useful to have a geometrical picture of the error function, which we can view as a surface sitting over weight space as shown in Figure 5.5. First note that if we make a small step in weight space from w to w+\u03b4w then the change in the error function is \u03b4E \u2243\u03b4wT\u2207E(w), where the vector \u2207E(w) points in the direction of greatest rate of increase of the error function. Because the error E(w) is a smooth continuous function of w, its smallest value will occur at a",

Points at which the gradient vanishes are called stationary points, and may be further classi\ufb01ed into minima, maxima, and saddle points. Our goal is to \ufb01nd a vector w such that E(w) takes its smallest value. How- ever, the error function typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights and bias parameters, and so there will be many points in weight space at which the gradient vanishes (or is numerically very small). Indeed, from the discussion in Sec- tion 5.1.1 we see that for any point w that is a local minimum, there will be other points in weight space that are equivalent minima. For instance, in a two-layer net- work of the kind shown in Figure 5.1, with M hidden units, each point in weight space is a member of a family of M!2M equivalent points. Section 5.1.1 Furthermore, there will typically be multiple inequivalent stationary points and in particular multiple inequivalent minima. A minimum that corresponds to the smallest value of the error function for any weight vector is said to be a global minimum. Any other minima corresponding to higher values of the error function are said to be local minima. For a successful application of neural networks, it may not be necessary to \ufb01nd the global minimum (and in general it will not be known whether the global minimum has been found) but it may be necessary to compare several local minima in order to \ufb01nd a suf\ufb01ciently good solution. Because there is clearly no hope of \ufb01nding an analytical solution to the equa- tion \u2207E(w) = 0 we resort to iterative numerical procedures. The optimization of continuous nonlinear functions is a widely studied problem and there exists an ex- tensive literature on how to solve it ef\ufb01ciently. Most techniques involve choosing some initial value w(0) for the weight vector and then moving through weight space in a succession of steps of the form w(\u03c4+1) = w(\u03c4) + \u2206w(\u03c4) (5.27) where \u03c4 labels the iteration step. Different algorithms involve different choices for the weight vector update \u2206w(\u03c4). Many algorithms make use of gradient information and therefore require that, after each update, the value of \u2207E(w) is evaluated at the new weight vector w(\u03c4+1). In order to understand the importance of gradient information, it is useful to consider a local approximation to the error function based on a Taylor expansion. 5.2.2 Local quadratic approximation Insight into the optimization problem, and into the various techniques for solv- ing it, can be obtained by considering a local quadratic approximation to the error function. Consider the Taylor expansion of E(w) around some point \u0001w in weight space E(w) \u2243E(\u0001w) + (w \u2212\u0001w)Tb + 1 2(w \u2212\u0001w)TH(w \u2212\u0001w) (5.28)",

Consider the particular case of a local quadratic approximation around a point w\u22c6that is a minimum of the error function.

The use of this gradient information can lead to signi\ufb01cant improvements in the speed with which the minima of the error function can be located. We can see why this is so, as follows. In the quadratic approximation to the error function, given in (5.28), the error surface is speci\ufb01ed by the quantities b and H, which contain a total of W(W + 3)/2 independent elements (because the matrix H is symmetric), where W is the Exercise 5.13 dimensionality of w (i.e., the total number of adaptive parameters in the network). The location of the minimum of this quadratic approximation therefore depends on O(W 2) parameters, and we should not expect to be able to locate the minimum until we have gathered O(W 2) independent pieces of information. If we do not make use of gradient information, we would expect to have to perform O(W 2) function",

Now compare this with an algorithm that makes use of the gradient information. Because each evaluation of \u2207E brings W items of information, we might hope to \ufb01nd the minimum of the function in O(W) gradient evaluations. As we shall see, by using error backpropagation, each such evaluation takes only O(W) steps and so the minimum can now be found in O(W 2) steps. For this reason, the use of gradient information forms the basis of practical algorithms for training neural networks. 5.2.4 Gradient descent optimization The simplest approach to using gradient information is to choose the weight update in (5.27) to comprise a small step in the direction of the negative gradient, so that w(\u03c4+1) = w(\u03c4) \u2212\u03b7\u2207E(w(\u03c4)) (5.41) where the parameter \u03b7 > 0 is known as the learning rate. After each such update, the gradient is re-evaluated for the new weight vector and the process repeated. Note that the error function is de\ufb01ned with respect to a training set, and so each step requires that the entire training set be processed in order to evaluate \u2207E. Techniques that use the whole data set at once are called batch methods. At each step the weight vector is moved in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of the error function, and so this approach is known as gradient descent or steepest descent. Although such an approach might intuitively seem reasonable, in fact it turns out to be a poor algorithm, for reasons discussed in Bishop and Nabney (2008). For batch optimization, there are more ef\ufb01cient methods, such as conjugate gra- dients and quasi-Newton methods, which are much more robust and much faster than simple gradient descent (Gill et al., 1981; Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999). Unlike gradient descent, these algorithms have the property that the error function always decreases at each iteration unless the weight vector has arrived at a local or global minimum. In order to \ufb01nd a suf\ufb01ciently good minimum, it may be necessary to run a gradient-based algorithm multiple times, each time using a different randomly cho- sen starting point, and comparing the resulting performance on an independent vali- dation set. There is, however, an on-line version of gradient descent that has proved useful in practice for training neural networks on large data sets (Le Cun et al., 1989). Error functions based on maximum likelihood for a set of independent observations comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point E(w) = N \u0002 n=1 En(w). (5.42) On-line gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent, makes an update to the weight vector based on one data point at a time, so that w(\u03c4+1) = w(\u03c4) \u2212\u03b7\u2207En(w(\u03c4)).

There are of course intermediate scenarios in which the updates are based on batches of data points. One advantage of on-line methods compared to batch methods is that the former handle redundancy in the data much more ef\ufb01ciently. To see, this consider an ex- treme example in which we take a data set and double its size by duplicating every data point. Note that this simply multiplies the error function by a factor of 2 and so is equivalent to using the original error function. Batch methods will require double the computational effort to evaluate the batch error function gradient, whereas on- line methods will be unaffected. Another property of on-line gradient descent is the possibility of escaping from local minima, since a stationary point with respect to the error function for the whole data set will generally not be a stationary point for each data point individually. Nonlinear optimization algorithms, and their practical application to neural net- work training, are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney (2008). 5.3. Error Backpropagation Our goal in this section is to \ufb01nd an ef\ufb01cient technique for evaluating the gradient of an error function E(w) for a feed-forward neural network. We shall see that this can be achieved using a local message passing scheme in which information is sent alternately forwards and backwards through the network and is known as error backpropagation, or sometimes simply as backprop. It should be noted that the term backpropagation is used in the neural com- puting literature to mean a variety of different things. For instance, the multilayer perceptron architecture is sometimes called a backpropagation network. The term backpropagation is also used to describe the training of a multilayer perceptron us- ing gradient descent applied to a sum-of-squares error function. In order to clarify the terminology, it is useful to consider the nature of the training process more care- fully. Most training algorithms involve an iterative procedure for minimization of an error function, with adjustments to the weights being made in a sequence of steps. At each such step, we can distinguish between two distinct stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, the derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights must be evaluated. As we shall see, the important contribution of the backpropagation technique is in pro- viding a computationally ef\ufb01cient method for evaluating such derivatives. Because it is at this stage that errors are propagated backwards through the network, we shall use the term backpropagation speci\ufb01cally to describe the evaluation of derivatives. In the second stage, the derivatives are then used to compute the adjustments to be made to the weights. The simplest such technique, and the one originally considered by Rumelhart et al. (1986), involves gradient descent. It is important to recognize that the two stages are distinct. Thus, the \ufb01rst stage, namely the propagation of er- rors backwards through the network in order to evaluate derivatives, can be applied to many other kinds of network and not just the multilayer perceptron. It can also be applied to error functions other that just the simple sum-of-squares, and to the eval-",

Similarly, the second stage of weight adjustment using the calculated derivatives can be tackled using a variety of optimization schemes, many of which are substantially more powerful than simple gradient descent. 5.3.1 Evaluation of error-function derivatives We now derive the backpropagation algorithm for a general network having ar- bitrary feed-forward topology, arbitrary differentiable nonlinear activation functions, and a broad class of error function. The resulting formulae will then be illustrated using a simple layered network structure having a single layer of sigmoidal hidden units together with a sum-of-squares error. Many error functions of practical interest, for instance those de\ufb01ned by maxi- mum likelihood for a set of i.i.d. data, comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point in the training set, so that E(w) = N \u0002 n=1 En(w). (5.44) Here we shall consider the problem of evaluating \u2207En(w) for one such term in the error function. This may be used directly for sequential optimization, or the results can be accumulated over the training set in the case of batch methods. Consider \ufb01rst a simple linear model in which the outputs yk are linear combina- tions of the input variables xi so that yk = \u0002 i wkixi (5.45) together with an error function that, for a particular input pattern n, takes the form En = 1 2 \u0002 k (ynk \u2212tnk)2 (5.46) where ynk = yk(xn, w). The gradient of this error function with respect to a weight wji is given by \u2202En \u2202wji = (ynj \u2212tnj)xni (5.47) which can be interpreted as a \u2018local\u2019 computation involving the product of an \u2018error signal\u2019 ynj \u2212tnj associated with the output end of the link wji and the variable xni associated with the input end of the link. In Section 4.3.2, we saw how a similar formula arises with the logistic sigmoid activation function together with the cross entropy error function, and similarly for the softmax activation function together with its matching cross-entropy error function. We shall now see how this simple result extends to the more complex setting of multilayer feed-forward networks. In a general feed-forward network, each unit computes a weighted sum of its inputs of the form aj = \u0002 i wjizi (5.48)",

In Section 5.1, we saw that biases can be included in this sum by introducing an extra unit, or input, with activation \ufb01xed at +1. We therefore do not need to deal with biases explicitly. The sum in (5.48) is transformed by a nonlinear activation function h(\u00b7) to give the activation zj of unit j in the form zj = h(aj). (5.49) Note that one or more of the variables zi in the sum in (5.48) could be an input, and similarly, the unit j in (5.49) could be an output. For each pattern in the training set, we shall suppose that we have supplied the corresponding input vector to the network and calculated the activations of all of the hidden and output units in the network by successive application of (5.48) and (5.49). This process is often called forward propagation because it can be regarded as a forward \ufb02ow of information through the network. Now consider the evaluation of the derivative of En with respect to a weight wji. The outputs of the various units will depend on the particular input pattern n. However, in order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall omit the subscript n from the network variables. First we note that En depends on the weight wji only via the summed input aj to unit j. We can therefore apply the chain rule for partial derivatives to give \u2202En \u2202wji = \u2202En \u2202aj \u2202aj \u2202wji . (5.50) We now introduce a useful notation \u03b4j \u2261\u2202En \u2202aj (5.51) where the \u03b4\u2019s are often referred to as errors for reasons we shall see shortly. Using (5.48), we can write \u2202aj \u2202wji = zi. (5.52) Substituting (5.51) and (5.52) into (5.50), we then obtain \u2202En \u2202wji = \u03b4jzi.

Note that this takes the same form as for the simple linear model considered at the start of this section. Thus, in order to evaluate the derivatives, we need only to calculate the value of \u03b4j for each hidden and output unit in the network, and then apply (5.53).

In order to illustrate the application of this algorithm, we shall consider a particular example. This is chosen both for its simplicity and for its practical importance, be- cause many applications of neural networks reported in the literature make use of this type of network.

(5.67) 5.3.3 Ef\ufb01ciency of backpropagation One of the most important aspects of backpropagation is its computational ef\ufb01- ciency. To understand this, let us examine how the number of computer operations required to evaluate the derivatives of the error function scales with the total number W of weights and biases in the network. A single evaluation of the error function (for a given input pattern) would require O(W) operations, for suf\ufb01ciently large W. This follows from the fact that, except for a network with very sparse connections, the number of weights is typically much greater than the number of units, and so the bulk of the computational effort in forward propagation is concerned with evaluat- ing the sums in (5.48), with the evaluation of the activation functions representing a small overhead. Each term in the sum in (5.48) requires one multiplication and one addition, leading to an overall computational cost that is O(W). An alternative approach to backpropagation for computing the derivatives of the error function is to use \ufb01nite differences. This can be done by perturbing each weight in turn, and approximating the derivatives by the expression \u2202En \u2202wji = En(wji + \u03f5) \u2212En(wji) \u03f5 + O(\u03f5) (5.68) where \u03f5 \u226a1. In a software simulation, the accuracy of the approximation to the derivatives can be improved by making \u03f5 smaller, until numerical roundoff problems arise. The accuracy of the \ufb01nite differences method can be improved signi\ufb01cantly by using symmetrical central differences of the form \u2202En \u2202wji = En(wji + \u03f5) \u2212En(wji \u2212\u03f5) 2\u03f5 + O(\u03f52). (5.69) In this case, the O(\u03f5) corrections cancel, as can be veri\ufb01ed by Taylor expansion on Exercise 5.14 the right-hand side of (5.69), and so the residual corrections are O(\u03f52). The number of computational steps is, however, roughly doubled compared with (5.68). The main problem with numerical differentiation is that the highly desirable O(W) scaling has been lost.

However, numerical differentiation plays an important role in practice, because a comparison of the derivatives calculated by backpropagation with those obtained us- ing central differences provides a powerful check on the correctness of any software implementation of the backpropagation algorithm. When training networks in prac- tice, derivatives should be evaluated using backpropagation, because this gives the greatest accuracy and numerical ef\ufb01ciency. However, the results should be compared with numerical differentiation using (5.69) for some test cases in order to check the correctness of the implementation. 5.3.4 The Jacobian matrix We have seen how the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights can be obtained by the propagation of errors backwards through the network. The technique of backpropagation can also be applied to the calculation of other deriva- tives. Here we consider the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix, whose elements are given by the derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the inputs Jki \u2261\u2202yk \u2202xi (5.70) where each such derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held \ufb01xed. Jacobian matrices play a useful role in systems built from a number of distinct modules, as illustrated in Figure 5.8. Each module can comprise a \ufb01xed or adaptive function, which can be linear or nonlinear, so long as it is differentiable. Suppose we wish to minimize an error function E with respect to the parameter w in Figure 5.8. The derivative of the error function is given by \u2202E \u2202w = \u0002 k,j \u2202E \u2202yk \u2202yk \u2202zj \u2202zj \u2202w (5.71) in which the Jacobian matrix for the red module in Figure 5.8 appears in the middle term. Because the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of the local sensitivity of the outputs to changes in each of the input variables, it also allows any known errors \u2206xi",

In general, the network mapping rep- resented by a trained neural network will be nonlinear, and so the elements of the Jacobian matrix will not be constants but will depend on the particular input vector used. Thus (5.72) is valid only for small perturbations of the inputs, and the Jacobian itself must be re-evaluated for each new input vector. The Jacobian matrix can be evaluated using a backpropagation procedure that is similar to the one derived earlier for evaluating the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights. We start by writing the element Jki in the form Jki = \u2202yk \u2202xi = \u0002 j \u2202yk \u2202aj \u2202aj \u2202xi = \u0002 j wji \u2202yk \u2202aj (5.73) where we have made use of (5.48). The sum in (5.73) runs over all units j to which the input unit i sends connections (for example, over all units in the \ufb01rst hidden layer in the layered topology considered earlier). We now write down a recursive backpropagation formula to determine the derivatives \u2202yk/\u2202aj \u2202yk \u2202aj = \u0002 l \u2202yk \u2202al \u2202al \u2202aj = h\u2032(aj) \u0002 l wlj \u2202yk \u2202al (5.74) where the sum runs over all units l to which unit j sends connections (corresponding to the \ufb01rst index of wlj). Again, we have made use of (5.48) and (5.49). This backpropagation starts at the output units for which the required derivatives can be found directly from the functional form of the output-unit activation function. For instance, if we have individual sigmoidal activation functions at each output unit, then \u2202yk \u2202aj = \u03b4kj\u03c3\u2032(aj) (5.75) whereas for softmax outputs we have \u2202yk \u2202aj = \u03b4kjyk \u2212ykyj.

Finally, use (5.73) to do the backpropagation to the inputs. The Jacobian can also be evaluated using an alternative forward propagation formalism, which can be derived in an analogous way to the backpropagation approach given here. Exercise 5.15 Again, the implementation of such algorithms can be checked by using numeri- cal differentiation in the form \u2202yk \u2202xi = yk(xi + \u03f5) \u2212yk(xi \u2212\u03f5) 2\u03f5 + O(\u03f52) (5.77) which involves 2D forward propagations for a network having D inputs. 5.4. The Hessian Matrix We have shown how the technique of backpropagation can be used to obtain the \ufb01rst derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights in the network. Back- propagation can also be used to evaluate the second derivatives of the error, given by \u22022E \u2202wji\u2202wlk . (5.78) Note that it is sometimes convenient to consider all of the weight and bias parameters as elements wi of a single vector, denoted w, in which case the second derivatives form the elements Hij of the Hessian matrix H, where i, j \u2208{1, . . . , W} and W is the total number of weights and biases. The Hessian plays an important role in many aspects of neural computing, including the following: 1. Several nonlinear optimization algorithms used for training neural networks are based on considerations of the second-order properties of the error surface, which are controlled by the Hessian matrix (Bishop and Nabney, 2008). 2. The Hessian forms the basis of a fast procedure for re-training a feed-forward network following a small change in the training data (Bishop, 1991). 3. The inverse of the Hessian has been used to identify the least signi\ufb01cant weights in a network as part of network \u2018pruning\u2019 algorithms (Le Cun et al., 1990). 4. The Hessian plays a central role in the Laplace approximation for a Bayesian neural network (see Section 5.7). Its inverse is used to determine the predic- tive distribution for a trained network, its eigenvalues determine the values of hyperparameters, and its determinant is used to evaluate the model evidence. Various approximation schemes have been used to evaluate the Hessian matrix for a neural network. However, the Hessian can also be calculated exactly using an extension of the backpropagation technique.",

    "text": "250 5. NEURAL NETWORKS An important consideration for many applications of the Hessian is the ef\ufb01ciency with which it can be evaluated. If there are W parameters (weights and biases) in the network, then the Hessian matrix has dimensions W \u00d7 W and so the computational effort needed to evaluate the Hessian will scale like O(W 2) for each pattern in the data set. As we shall see, there are ef\ufb01cient methods for evaluating the Hessian whose scaling is indeed O(W 2). 5.4.1 Diagonal approximation Some of the applications for the Hessian matrix discussed above require the inverse of the Hessian, rather than the Hessian itself. For this reason, there has been some interest in using a diagonal approximation to the Hessian, in other words one that simply replaces the off-diagonal elements with zeros, because its inverse is trivial to evaluate. Again, we shall consider an error function that consists of a sum of terms, one for each pattern in the data set, so that E = \u0005 n En. The Hessian can then be obtained by considering one pattern at a time, and then summing the results over all patterns. From (5.48), the diagonal elements of the Hessian, for pattern n, can be written \u22022En \u2202w2 ji = \u22022En \u2202a2 j z2 i . (5.79) Using (5.48) and (5.49), the second derivatives on the right-hand side of (5.79) can be found recursively using the chain rule of differential calculus to give a backprop- agation equation of the form \u22022En \u2202a2 j = h\u2032(aj)2 \u0002 k \u0002 k\u2032 wkjwk\u2032j \u22022En \u2202ak\u2202ak\u2032 + h\u2032\u2032(aj) \u0002 k wkj \u2202En \u2202ak . (5.80) If we now neglect off-diagonal elements in the second-derivative terms, we obtain (Becker and Le Cun, 1989; Le Cun et al., 1990) \u22022En \u2202a2 j = h\u2032(aj)2 \u0002 k w2 kj \u22022En \u2202a2 k + h\u2032\u2032(aj) \u0002 k wkj \u2202En \u2202ak . (5.81) Note that the number of computational steps required to evaluate this approximation is O(W), where W is the total number of weight and bias parameters in the network, compared with O(W 2) for the full Hessian. Ricotti et al. (1988) also used the diagonal approximation to the Hessian, but they retained all terms in the evaluation of \u22022En/\u2202a2 j and so obtained exact expres- sions for the diagonal terms. Note that this no longer has O(W) scaling. The major problem with diagonal approximations, however, is that in practice the Hessian is typically found to be strongly nondiagonal, and so these approximations, which are driven mainly be computational convenience, must be treated with care.",

The Hessian Matrix 251 5.4.2 Outer product approximation When neural networks are applied to regression problems, it is common to use a sum-of-squares error function of the form E = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 (yn \u2212tn)2 (5.82) where we have considered the case of a single output in order to keep the notation simple (the extension to several outputs is straightforward). We can then write the Exercise 5.16 Hessian matrix in the form H = \u2207\u2207E = N \u0002 n=1 \u2207yn\u2207yn + N \u0002 n=1 (yn \u2212tn)\u2207\u2207yn. (5.83) If the network has been trained on the data set, and its outputs yn happen to be very close to the target values tn, then the second term in (5.83) will be small and can be neglected. More generally, however, it may be appropriate to neglect this term by the following argument. Recall from Section 1.5.5 that the optimal function that minimizes a sum-of-squares loss is the conditional average of the target data. The quantity (yn \u2212tn) is then a random variable with zero mean. If we assume that its value is uncorrelated with the value of the second derivative term on the right-hand side of (5.83), then the whole term will average to zero in the summation over n. Exercise 5.17 By neglecting the second term in (5.83), we arrive at the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt approximation or outer product approximation (because the Hessian matrix is built up from a sum of outer products of vectors), given by H \u2243 N \u0002 n=1 bnbT n (5.84) where bn = \u2207yn = \u2207an because the activation function for the output units is simply the identity. Evaluation of the outer product approximation for the Hessian is straightforward as it only involves \ufb01rst derivatives of the error function, which can be evaluated ef\ufb01ciently in O(W) steps using standard backpropagation. The elements of the matrix can then be found in O(W 2) steps by simple multiplication. It is important to emphasize that this approximation is only likely to be valid for a network that has been trained appropriately, and that for a general network mapping the second derivative terms on the right-hand side of (5.83) will typically not be negligible. In the case of the cross-entropy error function for a network with logistic sigmoid output-unit activation functions, the corresponding approximation is given by Exercise 5.19 H \u2243 N \u0002 n=1 yn(1 \u2212yn)bnbT n.

NEURAL NETWORKS 5.4.3 Inverse Hessian We can use the outer-product approximation to develop a computationally ef- \ufb01cient procedure for approximating the inverse of the Hessian (Hassibi and Stork, 1993). First we write the outer-product approximation in matrix notation as HN = N \u0002 n=1 bnbT n (5.86) where bn \u2261\u2207wan is the contribution to the gradient of the output unit activation arising from data point n. We now derive a sequential procedure for building up the Hessian by including data points one at a time. Suppose we have already obtained the inverse Hessian using the \ufb01rst L data points. By separating off the contribution from data point L + 1, we obtain HL+1 = HL + bL+1bT L+1. (5.87) In order to evaluate the inverse of the Hessian, we now consider the matrix identity M + vvT \u22121 = M\u22121 \u2212(M\u22121v) vTM\u22121 1 + vTM\u22121v (5.88) where I is the unit matrix, which is simply a special case of the Woodbury identity (C.7). If we now identify HL with M and bL+1 with v, we obtain H\u22121 L+1 = H\u22121 L \u2212H\u22121 L bL+1bT L+1H\u22121 L 1 + bT L+1H\u22121 L bL+1 . (5.89) In this way, data points are sequentially absorbed until L+1 = N and the whole data set has been processed. This result therefore represents a procedure for evaluating the inverse of the Hessian using a single pass through the data set. The initial matrix H0 is chosen to be \u03b1I, where \u03b1 is a small quantity, so that the algorithm actually \ufb01nds the inverse of H + \u03b1I. The results are not particularly sensitive to the precise value of \u03b1. Extension of this algorithm to networks having more than one output is straightforward. Exercise 5.21 We note here that the Hessian matrix can sometimes be calculated indirectly as part of the network training algorithm. In particular, quasi-Newton nonlinear opti- mization algorithms gradually build up an approximation to the inverse of the Hes- sian during training. Such algorithms are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney (2008). 5.4.4 Finite differences As in the case of the \ufb01rst derivatives of the error function, we can \ufb01nd the second derivatives by using \ufb01nite differences, with accuracy limited by numerical precision. If we perturb each possible pair of weights in turn, we obtain \u22022E \u2202wji\u2202wlk = 1 4\u03f52 {E(wji + \u03f5, wlk + \u03f5) \u2212E(wji + \u03f5, wlk \u2212\u03f5) \u2212E(wji \u2212\u03f5, wlk + \u03f5) + E(wji \u2212\u03f5, wlk \u2212\u03f5)} + O(\u03f52).

Because there are W 2 elements in the Hessian matrix, and because the evaluation of each element requires four forward propagations each needing O(W) operations (per pattern), we see that this approach will require O(W 3) operations to evaluate the complete Hessian. It therefore has poor scaling properties, although in practice it is very useful as a check on the soft- ware implementation of backpropagation methods. A more ef\ufb01cient version of numerical differentiation can be found by applying central differences to the \ufb01rst derivatives of the error function, which are themselves calculated using backpropagation. This gives \u22022E \u2202wji\u2202wlk = 1 2\u03f5 \u2202E \u2202wji (wlk + \u03f5) \u2212\u2202E \u2202wji (wlk \u2212\u03f5) + O(\u03f52). (5.91) Because there are now only W weights to be perturbed, and because the gradients can be evaluated in O(W) steps, we see that this method gives the Hessian in O(W 2) operations. 5.4.5 Exact evaluation of the Hessian So far, we have considered various approximation schemes for evaluating the Hessian matrix or its inverse. The Hessian can also be evaluated exactly, for a net- work of arbitrary feed-forward topology, using extension of the technique of back- propagation used to evaluate \ufb01rst derivatives, which shares many of its desirable features including computational ef\ufb01ciency (Bishop, 1991; Bishop, 1992). It can be applied to any differentiable error function that can be expressed as a function of the network outputs and to networks having arbitrary differentiable activation func- tions. The number of computational steps needed to evaluate the Hessian scales like O(W 2). Similar algorithms have also been considered by Buntine and Weigend (1993). Here we consider the speci\ufb01c case of a network having two layers of weights, for which the required equations are easily derived. We shall use indices i and i\u2032 Exercise 5.22 to denote inputs, indices j and j\u2032 to denoted hidden units, and indices k and k\u2032 to denote outputs.

Inclusion of skip-layer connections is straightforward. Exercise 5.23 5.4.6 Fast multiplication by the Hessian For many applications of the Hessian, the quantity of interest is not the Hessian matrix H itself but the product of H with some vector v. We have seen that the evaluation of the Hessian takes O(W 2) operations, and it also requires storage that is O(W 2). The vector vTH that we wish to calculate, however, has only W elements, so instead of computing the Hessian as an intermediate step, we can instead try to \ufb01nd an ef\ufb01cient approach to evaluating vTH directly in a way that requires only O(W) operations. To do this, we \ufb01rst note that vTH = vT\u2207(\u2207E) (5.96) where \u2207denotes the gradient operator in weight space. We can then write down the standard forward-propagation and backpropagation equations for the evaluation of \u2207E and apply (5.96) to these equations to give a set of forward-propagation and backpropagation equations for the evaluation of vTH (M\u00f8ller, 1993; Pearlmutter, 1994). This corresponds to acting on the original forward-propagation and back- propagation equations with a differential operator vT\u2207. Pearlmutter (1994) used the notation R{\u00b7} to denote the operator vT\u2207, and we shall follow this convention. The analysis is straightforward and makes use of the usual rules of differential calculus, together with the result R{w} = v. (5.97) The technique is best illustrated with a simple example, and again we choose a two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 5.1, with linear output units and a sum-of-squares error function. As before, we consider the contribution to the error function from one pattern in the data set. The required vector is then obtained as",

For each input pattern, the values of these quantities can be found using the above results, and the elements of vTH are then given by (5.110) and (5.111). An elegant aspect of this technique is that the equations for evaluating vTH mirror closely those for standard forward and backward propagation, and so the extension of existing software to compute this product is typically straightforward. If desired, the technique can be used to evaluate the full Hessian matrix by choosing the vector v to be given successively by a series of unit vectors of the form (0, 0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) each of which picks out one column of the Hessian. This leads to a formalism that is analytically equivalent to the backpropagation procedure of Bishop (1992), as described in Section 5.4.5, though with some loss of ef\ufb01ciency due to redundant calculations. 5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks The number of input and outputs units in a neural network is generally determined by the dimensionality of the data set, whereas the number M of hidden units is a free parameter that can be adjusted to give the best predictive performance. Note that M controls the number of parameters (weights and biases) in the network, and so we might expect that in a maximum likelihood setting there will be an optimum value of M that gives the best generalization performance, corresponding to the optimum balance between under-\ufb01tting and over-\ufb01tting. Figure 5.9 shows an example of the effect of different values of M for the sinusoidal regression problem. The generalization error, however, is not a simple function of M due to the presence of local minima in the error function, as illustrated in Figure 5.10. Here we see the effect of choosing multiple random initializations for the weight vector for a range of values of M. The overall best validation set performance in this case occurred for a particular solution having M = 8. In practice, one approach to choosing M is in fact to plot a graph of the kind shown in Figure 5.10 and then to choose the speci\ufb01c solution having the smallest validation set error. There are, however, other ways to control the complexity of a neural network model in order to avoid over-\ufb01tting. From our discussion of polynomial curve \ufb01tting in Chapter 1, we see that an alternative approach is to choose a relatively large value for M and then to control complexity by the addition of a regularization term to the error function.

As we have seen previously, this regularizer can be interpreted as the negative logarithm of a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution over the weight vector w. 5.5.1 Consistent Gaussian priors One of the limitations of simple weight decay in the form (5.112) is that is inconsistent with certain scaling properties of network mappings. To illustrate this, consider a multilayer perceptron network having two layers of weights and linear output units, which performs a mapping from a set of input variables {xi} to a set of output variables {yk}.

(5.114) Suppose we perform a linear transformation of the input data of the form xi \u2192\u0004xi = axi + b. (5.115) Then we can arrange for the mapping performed by the network to be unchanged by making a corresponding linear transformation of the weights and biases from the inputs to the units in the hidden layer of the form Exercise 5.24 wji \u2192\u0004wji = 1 awji (5.116) wj0 \u2192\u0004wj0 = wj0 \u2212b a \u0002 i wji. (5.117) Similarly, a linear transformation of the output variables of the network of the form yk \u2192\u0004yk = cyk + d (5.118) can be achieved by making a transformation of the second-layer weights and biases using wkj \u2192\u0004wkj = cwkj (5.119) wk0 \u2192\u0004wk0 = cwk0 + d. (5.120) If we train one network using the original data and one network using data for which the input and/or target variables are transformed by one of the above linear transfor- mations, then consistency requires that we should obtain equivalent networks that differ only by the linear transformation of the weights as given. Any regularizer should be consistent with this property, otherwise it arbitrarily favours one solution over another, equivalent one. Clearly, simple weight decay (5.112), that treats all weights and biases on an equal footing, does not satisfy this property. We therefore look for a regularizer which is invariant under the linear trans- formations (5.116), (5.117), (5.119) and (5.120). These require that the regularizer should be invariant to re-scaling of the weights and to shifts of the biases. Such a regularizer is given by \u03bb1 2 \u0002 w\u2208W1 w2 + \u03bb2 2 \u0002 w\u2208W2 w2 (5.121) where W1 denotes the set of weights in the \ufb01rst layer, W2 denotes the set of weights in the second layer, and biases are excluded from the summations.

The regularizer (5.121) corresponds to a prior of the form p(w|\u03b11, \u03b12) \u221dexp \u0016 \u2212\u03b11 2 \u0002 w\u2208W1 w2 \u2212\u03b12 2 \u0002 w\u2208W2 w2 \u0017 . (5.122) Note that priors of this form are improper (they cannot be normalized) because the bias parameters are unconstrained. The use of improper priors can lead to dif\ufb01culties in selecting regularization coef\ufb01cients and in model comparison within the Bayesian framework, because the corresponding evidence is zero. It is therefore common to include separate priors for the biases (which then break shift invariance) having their own hyperparameters. We can illustrate the effect of the resulting four hyperpa- rameters by drawing samples from the prior and plotting the corresponding network functions, as shown in Figure 5.11. More generally, we can consider priors in which the weights are divided into any number of groups Wk so that p(w) \u221dexp \u0016 \u22121 2 \u0002 k \u03b1k\u2225w\u22252 k \u0017 (5.123) where \u2225w\u22252 k = \u0002 j\u2208Wk w2 j. (5.124) As a special case of this prior, if we choose the groups to correspond to the sets of weights associated with each of the input units, and we optimize the marginal likelihood with respect to the corresponding parameters \u03b1k, we obtain automatic relevance determination as discussed in Section 7.2.2. 5.5.2 Early stopping An alternative to regularization as a way of controlling the effective complexity of a network is the procedure of early stopping. The training of nonlinear network models corresponds to an iterative reduction of the error function de\ufb01ned with re- spect to a set of training data. For many of the optimization algorithms used for network training, such as conjugate gradients, the error is a nonincreasing function of the iteration index. However, the error measured with respect to independent data, generally called a validation set, often shows a decrease at \ufb01rst, followed by an in- crease as the network starts to over-\ufb01t. Training can therefore be stopped at the point of smallest error with respect to the validation data set, as indicated in Figure 5.12, in order to obtain a network having good generalization performance. The behaviour of the network in this case is sometimes explained qualitatively in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom in the network, in which this number starts out small and then to grows during the training process, corresponding to a steady increase in the effective complexity of the model.

The priors are governed by four hyperparameters \u03b1b 1, \u03b1w 1 , \u03b1b 2, and \u03b1w 2 , which represent the precisions of the Gaussian distributions of the \ufb01rst-layer biases, \ufb01rst-layer weights, second-layer biases, and second-layer weights, respectively. We see that the parameter \u03b1w 2 governs the vertical scale of functions (note the different vertical axis ranges on the top two diagrams), \u03b1w 1 governs the horizontal scale of variations in the function values, and \u03b1b 1 governs the horizontal range over which variations occur. The parameter \u03b1b 2, whose effect is not illustrated here, governs the range of vertical offsets of the functions. a minimum of the training error has been reached then represents a way of limiting the effective network complexity. In the case of a quadratic error function, we can verify this insight, and show that early stopping should exhibit similar behaviour to regularization using a sim- ple weight-decay term. This can be understood from Figure 5.13, in which the axes in weight space have been rotated to be parallel to the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. If, in the absence of weight decay, the weight vector starts at the origin and proceeds during training along a path that follows the local negative gradient vec- tor, then the weight vector will move initially parallel to the w2 axis through a point corresponding roughly to \u0004w and then move towards the minimum of the error func- tion wML. This follows from the shape of the error surface and the widely differing eigenvalues of the Hessian. Stopping at a point near \u0004w is therefore similar to weight decay. The relationship between early stopping and weight decay can be made quan- titative, thereby showing that the quantity \u03c4\u03b7 (where \u03c4 is the iteration index, and \u03b7 Exercise 5.25 is the learning rate parameter) plays the role of the reciprocal of the regularization",

The effective number of parameters in the network therefore grows during the course of training. 5.5.3 Invariances In many applications of pattern recognition, it is known that predictions should be unchanged, or invariant, under one or more transformations of the input vari- ables. For example, in the classi\ufb01cation of objects in two-dimensional images, such as handwritten digits, a particular object should be assigned the same classi\ufb01cation irrespective of its position within the image (translation invariance) or of its size (scale invariance). Such transformations produce signi\ufb01cant changes in the raw data, expressed in terms of the intensities at each of the pixels in the image, and yet should give rise to the same output from the classi\ufb01cation system. Similarly in speech recognition, small levels of nonlinear warping along the time axis, which preserve temporal ordering, should not change the interpretation of the signal. If suf\ufb01ciently large numbers of training patterns are available, then an adaptive model such as a neural network can learn the invariance, at least approximately. This involves including within the training set a suf\ufb01ciently large number of examples of the effects of the various transformations. Thus, for translation invariance in an im- age, the training set should include examples of objects at many different positions. This approach may be impractical, however, if the number of training examples is limited, or if there are several invariants (because the number of combinations of transformations grows exponentially with the number of such transformations). We therefore seek alternative approaches for encouraging an adaptive model to exhibit the required invariances. These can broadly be divided into four categories: 1. The training set is augmented using replicas of the training patterns, trans- formed according to the desired invariances. For instance, in our digit recog- nition example, we could make multiple copies of each example in which the",

A regularization term is added to the error function that penalizes changes in the model output when the input is transformed. This leads to the technique of tangent propagation, discussed in Section 5.5.4. 3. Invariance is built into the pre-processing by extracting features that are invari- ant under the required transformations. Any subsequent regression or classi- \ufb01cation system that uses such features as inputs will necessarily also respect these invariances. 4. The \ufb01nal option is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neu- ral network (or into the de\ufb01nition of a kernel function in the case of techniques such as the relevance vector machine). One way to achieve this is through the use of local receptive \ufb01elds and shared weights, as discussed in the context of convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6. Approach 1 is often relatively easy to implement and can be used to encourage com- plex invariances such as those illustrated in Figure 5.14. For sequential training algorithms, this can be done by transforming each input pattern before it is presented to the model so that, if the patterns are being recycled, a different transformation (drawn from an appropriate distribution) is added each time. For batch methods, a similar effect can be achieved by replicating each data point a number of times and transforming each copy independently. The use of such augmented data can lead to signi\ufb01cant improvements in generalization (Simard et al., 2003), although it can also be computationally costly. Approach 2 leaves the data set unchanged but modi\ufb01es the error function through the addition of a regularizer. In Section 5.5.5, we shall show that this approach is closely related to approach 2.",

One advantage of approach 3 is that it can correctly extrapolate well beyond the range of transformations included in the training set. However, it can be dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd hand-crafted features with the required invariances that do not also discard information that can be useful for discrimination. 5.5.4 Tangent propagation We can use regularization to encourage models to be invariant to transformations of the input through the technique of tangent propagation (Simard et al., 1992). Consider the effect of a transformation on a particular input vector xn. Provided the transformation is continuous (such as translation or rotation, but not mirror re\ufb02ection for instance), then the transformed pattern will sweep out a manifold M within the D-dimensional input space. This is illustrated in Figure 5.15, for the case of D = 2 for simplicity. Suppose the transformation is governed by a single parameter \u03be (which might be rotation angle for instance). Then the subspace M swept out by xn Figure 5.15 Illustration of a two-dimensional input space showing the effect of a continuous transforma- tion on a particular input vector xn.

Then the tangent to the curve M is given by the directional derivative \u03c4 = \u2202s/\u2202\u03be, and the tangent vector at the point xn is given by \u03c4 n = \u2202s(xn, \u03be) \u2202\u03be \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \u03be=0 .

In a practical implementation, the tangent vector \u03c4 n can be approximated us- ing \ufb01nite differences, by subtracting the original vector xn from the corresponding vector after transformation using a small value of \u03be, and then dividing by \u03be. This is illustrated in Figure 5.16. The regularization function depends on the network weights through the Jaco- bian J. A backpropagation formalism for computing the derivatives of the regu- larizer with respect to the network weights is easily obtained by extension of the Exercise 5.26 techniques introduced in Section 5.3. If the transformation is governed by L parameters (e.g., L = 3 for the case of translations combined with in-plane rotations in a two-dimensional image), then the manifold M will have dimensionality L, and the corresponding regularizer is given by the sum of terms of the form (5.128), one for each transformation. If several transformations are considered at the same time, and the network mapping is made invariant to each separately, then it will be (locally) invariant to combinations of the transformations (Simard et al., 1992).",

    "text": "5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks 267 We can further simplify this regularization term as follows. In Section 1.5.5 we saw that the function that minimizes the sum-of-squares error is given by the condi- tional average E[t|x] of the target values t. From (5.131) we see that the regularized error will equal the unregularized sum-of-squares plus terms which are O(\u03be), and so the network function that minimizes the total error will have the form y(x) = E[t|x] + O(\u03be). (5.133) Thus, to leading order in \u03be, the \ufb01rst term in the regularizer vanishes and we are left with \u2126= 1 2 \u0006 \u03c4 T \u2207y(x) 2 p(x) dx (5.134) which is equivalent to the tangent propagation regularizer (5.128). If we consider the special case in which the transformation of the inputs simply consists of the addition of random noise, so that x \u2192x + \u03be, then the regularizer takes the form Exercise 5.27 \u2126= 1 2 \u0006 \u2225\u2207y(x)\u22252 p(x) dx (5.135) which is known as Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Bishop, 1995b). Derivatives of this regularizer with respect to the network weights can be found using an extended backpropagation algorithm (Bishop, 1993). We see that, for small noise amplitudes, Tikhonov regularization is related to the addition of random noise to the inputs, which has been shown to improve generalization in appropriate circumstances (Sietsma and Dow, 1991). 5.5.6 Convolutional networks Another approach to creating models that are invariant to certain transformation of the inputs is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neural net- work. This is the basis for the convolutional neural network (Le Cun et al., 1989; LeCun et al., 1998), which has been widely applied to image data. Consider the speci\ufb01c task of recognizing handwritten digits. Each input image comprises a set of pixel intensity values, and the desired output is a posterior proba- bility distribution over the ten digit classes. We know that the identity of the digit is invariant under translations and scaling as well as (small) rotations. Furthermore, the network must also exhibit invariance to more subtle transformations such as elastic deformations of the kind illustrated in Figure 5.14. One simple approach would be to treat the image as the input to a fully connected network, such as the kind shown in Figure 5.1. Given a suf\ufb01ciently large training set, such a network could in principle yield a good solution to this problem and would learn the appropriate invariances by example. However, this approach ignores a key property of images, which is that nearby pixels are more strongly correlated than more distant pixels. Many of the modern approaches to computer vision exploit this property by extracting local features that depend only on small subregions of the image. Information from such features can then be merged in later stages of processing in order to detect higher-order features",

Also, local features that are useful in one region of the image are likely to be useful in other regions of the image, for instance if the object of interest is translated. These notions are incorporated into convolutional neural networks through three mechanisms: (i) local receptive \ufb01elds, (ii) weight sharing, and (iii) subsampling. The structure of a convolutional network is illustrated in Figure 5.17. In the convolutional layer the units are organized into planes, each of which is called a feature map. Units in a feature map each take inputs only from a small subregion of the image, and all of the units in a feature map are constrained to share the same weight values. For instance, a feature map might consist of 100 units arranged in a 10 \u00d7 10 grid, with each unit taking inputs from a 5\u00d75 pixel patch of the image. The whole feature map therefore has 25 adjustable weight parameters plus one adjustable bias parameter. Input values from a patch are linearly combined using the weights and the bias, and the result transformed by a sigmoidal nonlinearity using (5.1). If we think of the units as feature detectors, then all of the units in a feature map detect the same pattern but at different locations in the input image. Due to the weight sharing, the evaluation of the activations of these units is equivalent to a convolution of the image pixel intensities with a \u2018kernel\u2019 comprising the weight parameters. If the input image is shifted, the activations of the feature map will be shifted by the same amount but will otherwise be unchanged. This provides the basis for the (approximate) invariance of",

Because we will typically need to detect multiple features in order to build an effective model, there will generally be multiple feature maps in the convolutional layer, each having its own set of weight and bias parameters. The outputs of the convolutional units form the inputs to the subsampling layer of the network. For each feature map in the convolutional layer, there is a plane of units in the subsampling layer and each unit takes inputs from a small receptive \ufb01eld in the corresponding feature map of the convolutional layer. These units perform subsampling. For instance, each subsampling unit might take inputs from a 2 \u00d7 2 unit region in the corresponding feature map and would compute the average of those inputs, multiplied by an adaptive weight with the addition of an adaptive bias parameter, and then transformed using a sigmoidal nonlinear activation function. The receptive \ufb01elds are chosen to be contiguous and nonoverlapping so that there are half the number of rows and columns in the subsampling layer compared with the convolutional layer. In this way, the response of a unit in the subsampling layer will be relatively insensitive to small shifts of the image in the corresponding regions of the input space. In a practical architecture, there may be several pairs of convolutional and sub- sampling layers. At each stage there is a larger degree of invariance to input trans- formations compared to the previous layer. There may be several feature maps in a given convolutional layer for each plane of units in the previous subsampling layer, so that the gradual reduction in spatial resolution is then compensated by an increas- ing number of features. The \ufb01nal layer of the network would typically be a fully connected, fully adaptive layer, with a softmax output nonlinearity in the case of multiclass classi\ufb01cation. The whole network can be trained by error minimization using backpropagation to evaluate the gradient of the error function. This involves a slight modi\ufb01cation of the usual backpropagation algorithm to ensure that the shared-weight constraints are satis\ufb01ed. Due to the use of local receptive \ufb01elds, the number of weights in Exercise 5.28 the network is smaller than if the network were fully connected. Furthermore, the number of independent parameters to be learned from the data is much smaller still, due to the substantial numbers of constraints on the weights. 5.5.7 Soft weight sharing One way to reduce the effective complexity of a network with a large number of weights is to constrain weights within certain groups to be equal. This is the technique of weight sharing that was discussed in Section 5.5.6 as a way of building translation invariance into networks used for image interpretation. It is only appli- cable, however, to particular problems in which the form of the constraints can be speci\ufb01ed in advance. Here we consider a form of soft weight sharing (Nowlan and Hinton, 1992) in which the hard constraint of equal weights is replaced by a form of regularization in which groups of weights are encouraged to have similar values. Furthermore, the division of weights into groups, the mean weight value for each group, and the spread of values within the groups are all determined as part of the learning process.",

We can encour- age the weight values to form several groups, rather than just one group, by consid- ering instead a probability distribution that is a mixture of Gaussians. The centres Section 2.3.9 and variances of the Gaussian components, as well as the mixing coef\ufb01cients, will be considered as adjustable parameters to be determined as part of the learning process. Thus, we have a probability density of the form p(w) = \u000e i p(wi) (5.136) where p(wi) = M \u0002 j=1 \u03c0jN(wi|\u00b5j, \u03c32 j) (5.137) and \u03c0j are the mixing coef\ufb01cients.

This error is minimized both with respect to the weights wi and with respect to the parameters {\u03c0j, \u00b5j, \u03c3j} of the mixture model. If the weights were constant, then the parameters of the mixture model could be determined by using the EM algorithm discussed in Chapter 9. However, the dis- tribution of weights is itself evolving during the learning process, and so to avoid nu- merical instability, a joint optimization is performed simultaneously over the weights and the mixture-model parameters. This can be done using a standard optimization algorithm such as conjugate gradients or quasi-Newton methods. In order to minimize the total error function, it is necessary to be able to evaluate its derivatives with respect to the various adjustable parameters. To do this it is con- venient to regard the {\u03c0j} as prior probabilities and to introduce the corresponding posterior probabilities which, following (2.192), are given by Bayes\u2019 theorem in the form \u03b3j(w) = \u03c0jN(w|\u00b5j, \u03c32 j) \u0005 k \u03c0kN(w|\u00b5k, \u03c32 k).

Derivatives of the error with respect to the centres of the Gaussians are also easily computed to give Exercise 5.30 \u2202\u0004E \u2202\u00b5j = \u03bb \u0002 i \u03b3j(wi)(\u00b5i \u2212wj) \u03c32 j (5.142) which has a simple intuitive interpretation, because it pushes \u00b5j towards an aver- age of the weight values, weighted by the posterior probabilities that the respective weight parameters were generated by component j.

This en- sures that the parameters \u03c3j remain positive. It also has the effect of discouraging pathological solutions in which one or more of the \u03c3j goes to zero, corresponding to a Gaussian component collapsing onto one of the weight parameter values. Such solutions are discussed in more detail in the context of Gaussian mixture models in Section 9.2.1.

Mixture Density Networks The goal of supervised learning is to model a conditional distribution p(t|x), which for many simple regression problems is chosen to be Gaussian. However, practical machine learning problems can often have signi\ufb01cantly non-Gaussian distributions. These can arise, for example, with inverse problems in which the distribution can be multimodal, in which case the Gaussian assumption can lead to very poor predic- tions. As a simple example of an inverse problem, consider the kinematics of a robot arm, as illustrated in Figure 5.18. The forward problem involves \ufb01nding the end ef- Exercise 5.33 fector position given the joint angles and has a unique solution. However, in practice we wish to move the end effector of the robot to a speci\ufb01c position, and to do this we must set appropriate joint angles. We therefore need to solve the inverse problem, which has two solutions as seen in Figure 5.18. Forward problems often corresponds to causality in a physical system and gen- erally have a unique solution. For instance, a speci\ufb01c pattern of symptoms in the human body may be caused by the presence of a particular disease. In pattern recog- nition, however, we typically have to solve an inverse problem, such as trying to predict the presence of a disease given a set of symptoms. If the forward problem involves a many-to-one mapping, then the inverse problem will have multiple solu- tions. For instance, several different diseases may result in the same symptoms. In the robotics example, the kinematics is de\ufb01ned by geometrical equations, and the multimodality is readily apparent. However, in many machine learning problems the presence of multimodality, particularly in problems involving spaces of high di- mensionality, can be less obvious. For tutorial purposes, however, we shall consider a simple toy problem for which we can easily visualize the multimodality. Data for this problem is generated by sampling a variable x uniformly over the interval (0, 1), to give a set of values {xn}, and the corresponding target values tn are obtained",

Figure 5.19 shows the data sets for the forward and inverse problems, along with the results of \ufb01tting two-layer neural networks having 6 hidden units and a single linear output unit by minimizing a sum- of-squares error function. Least squares corresponds to maximum likelihood under a Gaussian assumption. We see that this leads to a very poor model for the highly non-Gaussian inverse problem. We therefore seek a general framework for modelling conditional probability distributions. This can be achieved by using a mixture model for p(t|x) in which both the mixing coef\ufb01cients as well as the component densities are \ufb02exible functions of the input vector x, giving rise to the mixture density network. For any given value of x, the mixture model provides a general formalism for modelling an arbitrary conditional density function p(t|x). Provided we consider a suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02exible network, we then have a framework for approximating arbitrary conditional distri- butions. Here we shall develop the model explicitly for Gaussian components, so that p(t|x) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0k(x)N t|\u00b5k(x), \u03c32 k(x) . (5.148) This is an example of a heteroscedastic model since the noise variance on the data is a function of the input vector x. Instead of Gaussians, we can use other distribu- tions for the components, such as Bernoulli distributions if the target variables are binary rather than continuous. We have also specialized to the case of isotropic co- variances for the components, although the mixture density network can readily be extended to allow for general covariance matrices by representing the covariances using a Cholesky factorization (Williams, 1996). Even with isotropic components, the conditional distribution p(t|x) does not assume factorization with respect to the components of t (in contrast to the standard sum-of-squares regression model) as a consequence of the mixture distribution. We now take the various parameters of the mixture model, namely the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0k(x), the means \u00b5k(x), and the variances \u03c32 k(x), to be governed by",

The structure of this mixture density network is illustrated in Figure 5.20. The mixture density network is closely related to the mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3. The principle difference is that in the mixture density network the same function is used to predict the parameters of all of the component densities as well as the mixing co- ef\ufb01cients, and so the nonlinear hidden units are shared amongst the input-dependent functions. The neural network in Figure 5.20 can, for example, be a two-layer network having sigmoidal (\u2018tanh\u2019) hidden units.

In such cases, the conditional mode may be of more value. Because the conditional mode for the mixture density network does not have a simple analytical solution, this would require numerical iteration.

Bayesian Neural Networks So far, our discussion of neural networks has focussed on the use of maximum like- lihood to determine the network parameters (weights and biases). Regularized max- imum likelihood can be interpreted as a MAP (maximum posterior) approach in which the regularizer can be viewed as the logarithm of a prior parameter distribu- tion. However, in a Bayesian treatment we need to marginalize over the distribution of parameters in order to make predictions. In Section 3.3, we developed a Bayesian solution for a simple linear regression model under the assumption of Gaussian noise. We saw that the posterior distribu- tion, which is Gaussian, could be evaluated exactly and that the predictive distribu- tion could also be found in closed form. In the case of a multilayered network, the highly nonlinear dependence of the network function on the parameter values means that an exact Bayesian treatment can no longer be found. In fact, the log of the pos- terior distribution will be nonconvex, corresponding to the multiple local minima in the error function. The technique of variational inference, to be discussed in Chapter 10, has been applied to Bayesian neural networks using a factorized Gaussian approximation",

We shall suppose that the conditional distribution p(t|x) is Gaussian, with an x-dependent mean given by the output of a neural network model y(x, w), and with precision (inverse variance) \u03b2 p(t|x, w, \u03b2) = N(t|y(x, w), \u03b2\u22121). (5.161) Similarly, we shall choose a prior distribution over the weights w that is Gaussian of the form p(w|\u03b1) = N(w|0, \u03b1\u22121I). (5.162) For an i.i.d. data set of N observations x1, . . . , xN, with a corresponding set of target values D = {t1, . . . , tN}, the likelihood function is given by p(D|w, \u03b2) = N \u000e n=1 N(tn|y(xn, w), \u03b2\u22121) (5.163) and so the resulting posterior distribution is then p(w|D, \u03b1, \u03b2) \u221dp(w|\u03b1)p(D|w, \u03b2). (5.164) which, as a consequence of the nonlinear dependence of y(x, w) on w, will be non- Gaussian. We can \ufb01nd a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution by using the Laplace approximation. To do this, we must \ufb01rst \ufb01nd a (local) maximum of the posterior, and this must be done using iterative numerical optimization. As usual, it is convenient to maximize the logarithm of the posterior, which can be written in the",

Assuming for the moment that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are \ufb01xed, we can \ufb01nd a maximum of the posterior, which we denote wMAP, by standard nonlinear optimization algorithms such as conjugate gradients, using error backpropagation to evaluate the required derivatives. Having found a mode wMAP, we can then build a local Gaussian approximation by evaluating the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log posterior distribu- tion. From (5.165), this is given by A = \u2212\u2207\u2207ln p(w|D, \u03b1, \u03b2) = \u03b1I + \u03b2H (5.166) where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of- squares error function with respect to the components of w. Algorithms for comput- ing and approximating the Hessian were discussed in Section 5.4. The corresponding Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given from (4.134) by q(w|D) = N(w|wMAP, A\u22121). (5.167) Similarly, the predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing with respect to this posterior distribution p(t|x, D) = \u0006 p(t|x, w)q(w|D) dw. (5.168) However, even with the Gaussian approximation to the posterior, this integration is still analytically intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function y(x, w) as a function of w. To make progress, we now assume that the posterior distribution has small variance compared with the characteristic scales of w over which y(x, w) is varying. This allows us to make a Taylor series expansion of the network function around wMAP and retain only the linear terms y(x, w) \u2243y(x, wMAP) + gT(w \u2212wMAP) (5.169) where we have de\ufb01ned g = \u2207wy(x, w)|w=wMAP . (5.170) With this approximation, we now have a linear-Gaussian model with a Gaussian distribution for p(w) and a Gaussian for p(t|w) whose mean is a linear function of w of the form p(t|x, w, \u03b2) \u2243N t|y(x, wMAP) + gT(w \u2212wMAP), \u03b2\u22121 . (5.171) We can therefore make use of the general result (2.115) for the marginal p(t) to give Exercise 5.38 p(t|x, D, \u03b1, \u03b2) = N t|y(x, wMAP), \u03c32(x) (5.172)",

(5.173) We see that the predictive distribution p(t|x, D) is a Gaussian whose mean is given by the network function y(x, wMAP) with the parameter set to their MAP value. The variance has two terms, the \ufb01rst of which arises from the intrinsic noise on the target variable, whereas the second is an x-dependent term that expresses the uncertainty in the interpolant due to the uncertainty in the model parameters w. This should be compared with the corresponding predictive distribution for the linear regression model, given by (3.58) and (3.59). 5.7.2 Hyperparameter optimization So far, we have assumed that the hyperparameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are \ufb01xed and known. We can make use of the evidence framework, discussed in Section 3.5, together with the Gaussian approximation to the posterior obtained using the Laplace approxima- tion, to obtain a practical procedure for choosing the values of such hyperparameters. The marginal likelihood, or evidence, for the hyperparameters is obtained by integrating over the network weights p(D|\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u0006 p(D|w, \u03b2)p(w|\u03b1) dw. (5.174) This is easily evaluated by making use of the Laplace approximation result (4.135). Exercise 5.39 Taking logarithms then gives ln p(D|\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2243\u2212E(wMAP) \u22121 2 ln |A| + W 2 ln \u03b1 + N 2 ln \u03b2 \u2212N 2 ln(2\u03c0) (5.175) where W is the total number of parameters in w, and the regularized error function is de\ufb01ned by E(wMAP) = \u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, wMAP) \u2212tn}2 + \u03b1 2 wT MAPwMAP. (5.176) We see that this takes the same form as the corresponding result (3.86) for the linear regression model. In the evidence framework, we make point estimates for \u03b1 and \u03b2 by maximizing ln p(D|\u03b1, \u03b2). Consider \ufb01rst the maximization with respect to \u03b1, which can be done by analogy with the linear regression case discussed in Section 3.5.2. We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the eigenvalue equation \u03b2Hui = \u03bbiui (5.177) where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of- squares error function, evaluated at w = wMAP.

(5.179) Note that this result was exact for the linear regression case. For the nonlinear neural network, however, it ignores the fact that changes in \u03b1 will cause changes in the Hessian H, which in turn will change the eigenvalues. We have therefore implicitly ignored terms involving the derivatives of \u03bbi with respect to \u03b1. Similarly, from (3.95) we see that maximizing the evidence with respect to \u03b2 gives the re-estimation formula 1 \u03b2 = 1 N \u2212\u03b3 N \u0002 n=1 {y(xn, wMAP) \u2212tn}2. (5.180) As with the linear model, we need to alternate between re-estimation of the hyper- parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 and updating of the posterior distribution. The situation with a neural network model is more complex, however, due to the multimodality of the posterior distribution. As a consequence, the solution for wMAP found by maximiz- ing the log posterior will depend on the initialization of w. Solutions that differ only as a consequence of the interchange and sign reversal symmetries in the hidden units Section 5.1.1 are identical so far as predictions are concerned, and it is irrelevant which of the equivalent solutions is found. However, there may be inequivalent solutions as well, and these will generally yield different values for the optimized hyperparameters. In order to compare different models, for example neural networks having differ- ent numbers of hidden units, we need to evaluate the model evidence p(D). This can be approximated by taking (5.175) and substituting the values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 obtained from the iterative optimization of these hyperparameters. A more careful evaluation is obtained by marginalizing over \u03b1 and \u03b2, again by making a Gaussian approxima- tion (MacKay, 1992c; Bishop, 1995a). In either case, it is necessary to evaluate the determinant |A| of the Hessian matrix. This can be problematic in practice because the determinant, unlike the trace, is sensitive to the small eigenvalues that are often dif\ufb01cult to determine accurately. The Laplace approximation is based on a local quadratic expansion around a mode of the posterior distribution over weights. We have seen in Section 5.1.1 that any given mode in a two-layer network is a member of a set of M!2M equivalent modes that differ by interchange and sign-change symmetries, where M is the num- ber of hidden units. When comparing networks having different numbers of hid- den units, this can be taken into account by multiplying the evidence by a factor of M!2M. 5.7.3 Bayesian neural networks for classi\ufb01cation So far, we have used the Laplace approximation to develop a Bayesian treat- ment of neural network regression models.

Here we shall con- sider a network having a single logistic sigmoid output corresponding to a two-class classi\ufb01cation problem. The extension to networks with multiclass softmax outputs is straightforward. We shall build extensively on the analogous results for linear Exercise 5.40 classi\ufb01cation models discussed in Section 4.5, and so we encourage the reader to familiarize themselves with that material before studying this section. The log likelihood function for this model is given by ln p(D|w) = \u0002 n = 1N {tn ln yn + (1 \u2212tn) ln(1 \u2212yn)} (5.181) where tn \u2208{0, 1} are the target values, and yn \u2261y(xn, w). Note that there is no hyperparameter \u03b2, because the data points are assumed to be correctly labelled. As before, the prior is taken to be an isotropic Gaussian of the form (5.162). The \ufb01rst stage in applying the Laplace framework to this model is to initialize the hyperparameter \u03b1, and then to determine the parameter vector w by maximizing the log posterior distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the regularized error function E(w) = \u2212ln p(D|w) + \u03b1 2 wTw (5.182) and can be achieved using error backpropagation combined with standard optimiza- tion algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.3. Having found a solution wMAP for the weight vector, the next step is to eval- uate the Hessian matrix H comprising the second derivatives of the negative log likelihood function. This can be done, for instance, using the exact method of Sec- tion 5.4.5, or using the outer product approximation given by (5.85). The second derivatives of the negative log posterior can again be written in the form (5.166), and the Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given by (5.167). To optimize the hyperparameter \u03b1, we again maximize the marginal likelihood, which is easily shown to take the form Exercise 5.41 ln p(D|\u03b1) \u2243\u2212E(wMAP) \u22121 2 ln |A| + W 2 ln \u03b1 + const (5.183) where the regularized error function is de\ufb01ned by E(wMAP) = \u2212 N \u0002 n=1 {tn ln yn + (1 \u2212tn) ln(1 \u2212yn)} + \u03b1 2 wT MAPwMAP (5.184) in which yn \u2261y(xn, wMAP). Maximizing this evidence function with respect to \u03b1 again leads to the re-estimation equation given by (5.178). The use of the evidence procedure to determine \u03b1 is illustrated in Figure 5.22 for the synthetic two-dimensional data discussed in Appendix A. Finally, we need the predictive distribution, which is de\ufb01ned by (5.168). Again, this integration is intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function. The",

(5.185) We can improve on this, however, by taking account of the variance of the posterior distribution. In this case, a linear approximation for the network outputs, as was used in the case of regression, would be inappropriate due to the logistic sigmoid output- unit activation function that constrains the output to lie in the range (0, 1). Instead, we make a linear approximation for the output unit activation in the form a(x, w) \u2243aMAP(x) + bT(w \u2212wMAP) (5.186) where aMAP(x) = a(x, wMAP), and the vector b \u2261\u2207a(x, wMAP) can be found by backpropagation. Because we now have a Gaussian approximation for the posterior distribution over w, and a model for a that is a linear function of w, we can now appeal to the results of Section 4.5.2. The distribution of output unit activation values, induced by the distribution over network weights, is given by p(a|x, D) = \u0006 \u03b4 a \u2212aMAP(x) \u2212bT(x)(w \u2212wMAP) q(w|D) dw (5.187) where q(w|D) is the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution given by (5.167).

During the learning phase, a set of training data is used either to obtain a point estimate of the parameter vector or to determine a posterior distribution over this vector. The training data is then discarded, and predictions for new inputs are based purely on the learned parameter vector w. This approach is also used in nonlinear parametric models such as neural networks.

These are examples of memory-based methods that involve storing the entire training set in order to make predictions for future data points. They typically require a metric to be de\ufb01ned that measures the similarity of any two vectors in input space, and are generally fast to \u2018train\u2019 but slow at making predictions for test data points. Many linear parametric models can be re-cast into an equivalent \u2018dual represen- tation\u2019 in which the predictions are also based on linear combinations of a kernel function evaluated at the training data points. As we shall see, for models which are based on a \ufb01xed nonlinear feature space mapping \u03c6(x), the kernel function is given by the relation k(x, x\u2032) = \u03c6(x)T\u03c6(x\u2032). (6.1) From this de\ufb01nition, we see that the kernel is a symmetric function of its arguments so that k(x, x\u2032) = k(x\u2032, x). The kernel concept was introduced into the \ufb01eld of pat- tern recognition by Aizerman et al. (1964) in the context of the method of potential functions, so-called because of an analogy with electrostatics. Although neglected for many years, it was re-introduced into machine learning in the context of large- margin classi\ufb01ers by Boser et al. (1992) giving rise to the technique of support vector machines. Since then, there has been considerable interest in this topic, both Chapter 7 in terms of theory and applications. One of the most signi\ufb01cant developments has been the extension of kernels to handle symbolic objects, thereby greatly expanding the range of problems that can be addressed. The simplest example of a kernel function is obtained by considering the identity mapping for the feature space in (6.1) so that \u03c6(x) = x, in which case k(x, x\u2032) = xTx\u2032. We shall refer to this as the linear kernel. The concept of a kernel formulated as an inner product in a feature space allows us to build interesting extensions of many well-known algorithms by making use of the kernel trick, also known as kernel substitution. The general idea is that, if we have an algorithm formulated in such a way that the input vector x enters only in the form of scalar products, then we can replace that scalar product with some other choice of kernel. For instance, the technique of kernel substitution can be applied to principal component analysis in order to develop a nonlinear variant of PCA (Sch\u00a8olkopf et al., Section 12.3 1998). Other examples of kernel substitution include nearest-neighbour classi\ufb01ers and the kernel Fisher discriminant (Mika et al., 1999; Roth and Steinhage, 2000; Baudat and Anouar, 2000). There are numerous forms of kernel functions in common use, and we shall en- counter several examples in this chapter. Many have the property of being a function only of the difference between the arguments, so that k(x, x\u2032) = k(x \u2212x\u2032), which are known as stationary kernels because they are invariant to translations in input space. A further specialization involves homogeneous kernels, also known as ra- dial basis functions, which depend only on the magnitude of the distance (typically Section 6.3 Euclidean) between the arguments so that k(x, x\u2032) = k(\u2225x \u2212x\u2032\u2225).

Dual Representations Many linear models for regression and classi\ufb01cation can be reformulated in terms of a dual representation in which the kernel function arises naturally. This concept will play an important role when we consider support vector machines in the next chapter. Here we consider a linear regression model whose parameters are determined by minimizing a regularized sum-of-squares error function given by J(w) = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 \u001a wT\u03c6(xn) \u2212tn \u001b2 + \u03bb 2 wTw (6.2) where \u03bb \u2a7e0. If we set the gradient of J(w) with respect to w equal to zero, we see that the solution for w takes the form of a linear combination of the vectors \u03c6(xn), with coef\ufb01cients that are functions of w, of the form w = \u22121 \u03bb N \u0002 n=1 \u001a wT\u03c6(xn) \u2212tn \u001b \u03c6(xn) = N \u0002 n=1 an\u03c6(xn) = \u03a6Ta (6.3) where \u03a6 is the design matrix, whose nth row is given by \u03c6(xn)T. Here the vector a = (a1, . . . , aN)T, and we have de\ufb01ned an = \u22121 \u03bb \u001a wT\u03c6(xn) \u2212tn \u001b . (6.4) Instead of working with the parameter vector w, we can now reformulate the least- squares algorithm in terms of the parameter vector a, giving rise to a dual represen- tation. If we substitute w = \u03a6Ta into J(w), we obtain J(a) = 1 2aT\u03a6\u03a6T\u03a6\u03a6Ta \u2212aT\u03a6\u03a6Tt + 1 2tTt + \u03bb 2 aT\u03a6\u03a6Ta (6.5) where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. We now de\ufb01ne the Gram matrix K = \u03a6\u03a6T, which is an N \u00d7 N symmetric matrix with elements Knm = \u03c6(xn)T\u03c6(xm) = k(xn, xm) (6.6) where we have introduced the kernel function k(x, x\u2032) de\ufb01ned by (6.1). In terms of the Gram matrix, the sum-of-squares error function can be written as J(a) = 1 2aTKKa \u2212aTKt + 1 2tTt + \u03bb 2 aTKa. (6.7) Setting the gradient of J(a) with respect to a to zero, we obtain the following solu- tion a = (K + \u03bbIN)\u22121 t. (6.8)",

KERNEL METHODS If we substitute this back into the linear regression model, we obtain the following prediction for a new input x y(x) = wT\u03c6(x) = aT\u03a6\u03c6(x) = k(x)T (K + \u03bbIN)\u22121 t (6.9) where we have de\ufb01ned the vector k(x) with elements kn(x) = k(xn, x). Thus we see that the dual formulation allows the solution to the least-squares problem to be expressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x\u2032). This is known as a dual formulation because, by noting that the solution for a can be expressed as a linear combination of the elements of \u03c6(x), we recover the original formulation in terms of the parameter vector w. Note that the prediction at x is given by a linear combination Exercise 6.1 of the target values from the training set. In fact, we have already obtained this result, using a slightly different notation, in Section 3.3.3. In the dual formulation, we determine the parameter vector a by inverting an N \u00d7 N matrix, whereas in the original parameter space formulation we had to invert an M \u00d7 M matrix in order to determine w. Because N is typically much larger than M, the dual formulation does not seem to be particularly useful. However, the advantage of the dual formulation, as we shall see, is that it is expressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x\u2032). We can therefore work directly in terms of kernels and avoid the explicit introduction of the feature vector \u03c6(x), which allows us implicitly to use feature spaces of high, even in\ufb01nite, dimensionality. The existence of a dual representation based on the Gram matrix is a property of many linear models, including the perceptron. In Section 6.4, we will develop a dual- Exercise 6.2 ity between probabilistic linear models for regression and the technique of Gaussian processes. Duality will also play an important role when we discuss support vector machines in Chapter 7. 6.2. Constructing Kernels In order to exploit kernel substitution, we need to be able to construct valid kernel functions. One approach is to choose a feature space mapping \u03c6(x) and then use this to \ufb01nd the corresponding kernel, as is illustrated in Figure 6.1. Here the kernel function is de\ufb01ned for a one-dimensional input space by k(x, x\u2032) = \u03c6(x)T\u03c6(x\u2032) = M \u0002 i=1 \u03c6i(x)\u03c6i(x\u2032) (6.10) where \u03c6i(x) are the basis functions. An alternative approach is to construct kernel functions directly. In this case, we must ensure that the function we choose is a valid kernel, in other words that it corresponds to a scalar product in some (perhaps in\ufb01nite dimensional) feature space. As a simple example, consider a kernel function given by k(x, z) = xTz 2 . (6.11)",

A necessary and suf\ufb01cient condition for a function k(x, x\u2032) to be a valid kernel (Shawe- Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) is that the Gram matrix K, whose elements are given by k(xn, xm), should be positive semide\ufb01nite for all possible choices of the set {xn}. Note that a positive semide\ufb01nite matrix is not the same thing as a matrix whose elements are nonnegative.

Equipped with these properties, we can now embark on the construction of more complex kernels appropriate to speci\ufb01c applications. We require that the kernel k(x, x\u2032) be symmetric and positive semide\ufb01nite and that it expresses the appropriate form of similarity between x and x\u2032 according to the intended application. Here we consider a few common examples of kernel functions. For a more extensive discus- sion of \u2018kernel engineering\u2019, see Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004). We saw that the simple polynomial kernel k(x, x\u2032) = xTx\u2032 2 contains only terms of degree two. If we consider the slightly generalized kernel k(x, x\u2032) = xTx\u2032 + c 2 with c > 0, then the corresponding feature mapping \u03c6(x) contains con- stant and linear terms as well as terms of order two. Similarly, k(x, x\u2032) = xTx\u2032 M contains all monomials of order M. For instance, if x and x\u2032 are two images, then the kernel represents a particular weighted sum of all possible products of M pixels in the \ufb01rst image with M pixels in the second image. This can similarly be gener- alized to include all terms up to degree M by considering k(x, x\u2032) = xTx\u2032 + c M with c > 0. Using the results (6.17) and (6.18) for combining kernels we see that these will all be valid kernel functions. Another commonly used kernel takes the form k(x, x\u2032) = exp \u2212\u2225x \u2212x\u2032\u22252/2\u03c32 (6.23) and is often called a \u2018Gaussian\u2019 kernel.

Note that the feature vector that corresponds to the Gaussian kernel has in\ufb01nite dimensionality. Exercise 6.11 The Gaussian kernel is not restricted to the use of Euclidean distance. If we use kernel substitution in (6.24) to replace xTx\u2032 with a nonlinear kernel \u03ba(x, x\u2032), we obtain k(x, x\u2032) = exp \u22121 2\u03c32 (\u03ba(x, x) + \u03ba(x\u2032, x\u2032) \u22122\u03ba(x, x\u2032)) . (6.26) An important contribution to arise from the kernel viewpoint has been the exten- sion to inputs that are symbolic, rather than simply vectors of real numbers. Kernel functions can be de\ufb01ned over objects as diverse as graphs, sets, strings, and text doc- uments. Consider, for instance, a \ufb01xed set and de\ufb01ne a nonvectorial space consisting of all possible subsets of this set. If A1 and A2 are two such subsets then one simple choice of kernel would be k(A1, A2) = 2|A1\u2229A2| (6.27) where A1 \u2229A2 denotes the intersection of sets A1 and A2, and |A| denotes the number of subsets in A. This is a valid kernel function because it can be shown to correspond to an inner product in a feature space. Exercise 6.12 One powerful approach to the construction of kernels starts from a probabilistic generative model (Haussler, 1999), which allows us to apply generative models in a discriminative setting. Generative models can deal naturally with missing data and in the case of hidden Markov models can handle sequences of varying length. By contrast, discriminative models generally give better performance on discriminative tasks than generative models. It is therefore of some interest to combine these two approaches (Lasserre et al., 2006). One way to combine them is to use a generative model to de\ufb01ne a kernel, and then use this kernel in a discriminative approach. Given a generative model p(x) we can de\ufb01ne a kernel by k(x, x\u2032) = p(x)p(x\u2032). (6.28) This is clearly a valid kernel function because we can interpret it as an inner product in the one-dimensional feature space de\ufb01ned by the mapping p(x). It says that two inputs x and x\u2032 are similar if they both have high probabilities. We can use (6.13) and (6.17) to extend this class of kernels by considering sums over products of different probability distributions, with positive weighting coef\ufb01cients p(i), of the form k(x, x\u2032) = \u0002 i p(x|i)p(x\u2032|i)p(i).

KERNEL METHODS This is equivalent, up to an overall multiplicative constant, to a mixture distribution in which the components factorize, with the index i playing the role of a \u2018latent\u2019 variable. Two inputs x and x\u2032 will give a large value for the kernel function, and Section 9.2 hence appear similar, if they have signi\ufb01cant probability under a range of different components. Taking the limit of an in\ufb01nite sum, we can also consider kernels of the form k(x, x\u2032) = \u0006 p(x|z)p(x\u2032|z)p(z) dz (6.30) where z is a continuous latent variable. Now suppose that our data consists of ordered sequences of length L so that an observation is given by X = {x1, . . . , xL}. A popular generative model for sequences is the hidden Markov model, which expresses the distribution p(X) as a Section 13.2 marginalization over a corresponding sequence of hidden states Z = {z1, . . . , zL}. We can use this approach to de\ufb01ne a kernel function measuring the similarity of two sequences X and X\u2032 by extending the mixture representation (6.29) to give k(X, X\u2032) = \u0002 Z p(X|Z)p(X\u2032|Z)p(Z) (6.31) so that both observed sequences are generated by the same hidden sequence Z. This model can easily be extended to allow sequences of differing length to be compared. An alternative technique for using generative models to de\ufb01ne kernel functions is known as the Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999). Consider a parametric generative model p(x|\u03b8) where \u03b8 denotes the vector of parameters. The goal is to \ufb01nd a kernel that measures the similarity of two input vectors x and x\u2032 induced by the generative model. Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) consider the gradient with respect to \u03b8, which de\ufb01nes a vector in a \u2018feature\u2019 space having the same dimensionality as \u03b8. In particular, they consider the Fisher score g(\u03b8, x) = \u2207\u03b8 ln p(x|\u03b8) (6.32) from which the Fisher kernel is de\ufb01ned by k(x, x\u2032) = g(\u03b8, x)TF\u22121g(\u03b8, x\u2032). (6.33) Here F is the Fisher information matrix, given by F = Ex \b g(\u03b8, x)g(\u03b8, x)T (6.34) where the expectation is with respect to x under the distribution p(x|\u03b8). This can be motivated from the perspective of information geometry (Amari, 1998), which considers the differential geometry of the space of model parameters. Here we sim- ply note that the presence of the Fisher information matrix causes this kernel to be invariant under a nonlinear re-parameterization of the density model \u03b8 \u2192\u03c8(\u03b8). Exercise 6.13 In practice, it is often infeasible to evaluate the Fisher information matrix. One approach is simply to replace the expectation in the de\ufb01nition of the Fisher informa- tion with the sample average, giving F \u22431 N N \u0002 n=1 g(\u03b8, xn)g(\u03b8, xn)T. (6.35)",

More simply, we can just omit the Fisher Section 12.1.3 information matrix altogether and use the noninvariant kernel k(x, x\u2032) = g(\u03b8, x)Tg(\u03b8, x\u2032). (6.36) An application of Fisher kernels to document retrieval is given by Hofmann (2000). A \ufb01nal example of a kernel function is the sigmoidal kernel given by k(x, x\u2032) = tanh axTx\u2032 + b (6.37) whose Gram matrix in general is not positive semide\ufb01nite. This form of kernel has, however, been used in practice (Vapnik, 1995), possibly because it gives kernel expansions such as the support vector machine a super\ufb01cial resemblance to neural network models. As we shall see, in the limit of an in\ufb01nite number of basis functions, a Bayesian neural network with an appropriate prior reduces to a Gaussian process, thereby providing a deeper link between neural networks and kernel methods. Section 6.4.7 6.3. Radial Basis Function Networks In Chapter 3, we discussed regression models based on linear combinations of \ufb01xed basis functions, although we did not discuss in detail what form those basis functions might take. One choice that has been widely used is that of radial basis functions, which have the property that each basis function depends only on the radial distance (typically Euclidean) from a centre \u00b5j, so that \u03c6j(x) = h(\u2225x \u2212\u00b5j\u2225). Historically, radial basis functions were introduced for the purpose of exact func- tion interpolation (Powell, 1987). Given a set of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along with corresponding target values {t1, . . . , tN}, the goal is to \ufb01nd a smooth function f(x) that \ufb01ts every target value exactly, so that f(xn) = tn for n = 1, . . . , N. This is achieved by expressing f(x) as a linear combination of radial basis functions, one centred on every data point f(x) = N \u0002 n=1 wnh(\u2225x \u2212xn\u2225). (6.38) The values of the coef\ufb01cients {wn} are found by least squares, and because there are the same number of coef\ufb01cients as there are constraints, the result is a function that \ufb01ts every target value exactly. In pattern recognition applications, however, the target values are generally noisy, and exact interpolation is undesirable because this corresponds to an over-\ufb01tted solution. Expansions in radial basis functions also arise from regularization theory (Pog- gio and Girosi, 1990; Bishop, 1995a). For a sum-of-squares error function with a regularizer de\ufb01ned in terms of a differential operator, the optimal solution is given by an expansion in the Green\u2019s functions of the operator (which are analogous to the eigenvectors of a discrete matrix), again with one basis function centred on each data",

    "text": "300 6. KERNEL METHODS point. If the differential operator is isotropic then the Green\u2019s functions depend only on the radial distance from the corresponding data point. Due to the presence of the regularizer, the solution no longer interpolates the training data exactly. Another motivation for radial basis functions comes from a consideration of the interpolation problem when the input (rather than the target) variables are noisy (Webb, 1994; Bishop, 1995a). If the noise on the input variable x is described by a variable \u03be having a distribution \u03bd(\u03be), then the sum-of-squares error function becomes E = 1 2 N \u0002 n=1 \u0006 {y(xn + \u03be) \u2212tn}2 \u03bd(\u03be) d\u03be. (6.39) Using the calculus of variations, we can optimize with respect to the function f(x) Appendix D to give Exercise 6.17 y(xn) = N \u0002 n=1 tnh(x \u2212xn) (6.40) where the basis functions are given by h(x \u2212xn) = \u03bd(x \u2212xn) N \u0002 n=1 \u03bd(x \u2212xn) . (6.41) We see that there is one basis function centred on every data point. This is known as the Nadaraya-Watson model and will be derived again from a different perspective in Section 6.3.1. If the noise distribution \u03bd(\u03be) is isotropic, so that it is a function only of \u2225\u03be\u2225, then the basis functions will be radial. Note that the basis functions (6.41) are normalized, so that \u0005 n h(x \u2212xn) = 1 for any value of x. The effect of such normalization is shown in Figure 6.2. Normal- ization is sometimes used in practice as it avoids having regions of input space where all of the basis functions take small values, which would necessarily lead to predic- tions in such regions that are either small or controlled purely by the bias parameter. Another situation in which expansions in normalized radial basis functions arise is in the application of kernel density estimation to the problem of regression, as we shall discuss in Section 6.3.1. Because there is one basis function associated with every data point, the corre- sponding model can be computationally costly to evaluate when making predictions for new data points. Models have therefore been proposed (Broomhead and Lowe, 1988; Moody and Darken, 1989; Poggio and Girosi, 1990), which retain the expan- sion in radial basis functions but where the number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points. Typically, the number of basis functions, and the locations \u00b5i of their centres, are determined based on the input data {xn} alone. The basis functions are then kept \ufb01xed and the coef\ufb01cients {wi} are determined by least squares by solving the usual set of linear equations, as discussed in Section 3.1.1.",

One of the simplest ways of choosing basis function centres is to use a randomly chosen subset of the data points. A more systematic approach is called orthogonal least squares (Chen et al., 1991). This is a sequential selection process in which at each step the next data point to be chosen as a basis function centre corresponds to the one that gives the greatest reduction in the sum-of-squares error. Values for the expansion coef\ufb01cients are determined as part of the algorithm. Clustering algorithms such as K-means have also been used, which give a set of basis function centres that Section 9.1 no longer coincide with training data points. 6.3.1 Nadaraya-Watson model In Section 3.3.3, we saw that the prediction of a linear regression model for a new input x takes the form of a linear combination of the training set target values with coef\ufb01cients given by the \u2018equivalent kernel\u2019 (3.62) where the equivalent kernel satis\ufb01es the summation constraint (3.64). We can motivate the kernel regression model (3.61) from a different perspective, starting with kernel density estimation. Suppose we have a training set {xn, tn} and we use a Parzen density estimator to model the joint distribution p(x, t), so that Section 2.5.1 p(x, t) = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 f(x \u2212xn, t \u2212tn) (6.42) where f(x, t) is the component density function, and there is one such component centred on each data point.

The corresponding conditional distribution (6.48) is given by a Gaus- sian mixture, and is shown, together with the conditional mean, for the sinusoidal Exercise 6.18 synthetic data set in Figure 6.3. An obvious extension of this model is to allow for more \ufb02exible forms of Gaus- sian components, for instance having different variance parameters for the input and target variables. More generally, we could model the joint distribution p(t, x) using a Gaussian mixture model, trained using techniques discussed in Chapter 9 (Ghahra- mani and Jordan, 1994), and then \ufb01nd the corresponding conditional distribution p(t|x). In this latter case we no longer have a representation in terms of kernel func- tions evaluated at the training set data points. However, the number of components in the mixture model can be smaller than the number of training set points, resulting in a model that is faster to evaluate for test data points. We have thereby accepted an increased computational cost during the training phase in order to have a model that is faster at making predictions. 6.4.

In Chapter 3, we considered linear regression models of the form y(x, w) = wT\u03c6(x) in which w is a vector of parameters and \u03c6(x) is a vector of \ufb01xed nonlinear basis functions that depend on the input vector x. We showed that a prior distribution over w induced a corresponding prior distribution over functions y(x, w). Given a training data set, we then evaluated the posterior distribution over w and thereby obtained the corresponding posterior distribution over regression functions, which in turn (with the addition of noise) implies a predictive distribution p(t|x) for new input vectors x. In the Gaussian process viewpoint, we dispense with the parametric model and instead de\ufb01ne a prior probability distribution over functions directly. At \ufb01rst sight, it might seem dif\ufb01cult to work with a distribution over the uncountably in\ufb01nite space of functions. However, as we shall see, for a \ufb01nite training set we only need to consider the values of the function at the discrete set of input values xn corresponding to the training set and test set data points, and so in practice we can work in a \ufb01nite space. Models equivalent to Gaussian processes have been widely studied in many dif- ferent \ufb01elds. For instance, in the geostatistics literature Gaussian process regression is known as kriging (Cressie, 1993). Similarly, ARMA (autoregressive moving aver- age) models, Kalman \ufb01lters, and radial basis function networks can all be viewed as forms of Gaussian process models. Reviews of Gaussian processes from a machine learning perspective can be found in MacKay (1998), Williams (1999), and MacKay (2003), and a comparison of Gaussian process models with alternative approaches is given in Rasmussen (1996). See also Rasmussen and Williams (2006) for a recent textbook on Gaussian processes. 6.4.1 Linear regression revisited In order to motivate the Gaussian process viewpoint, let us return to the linear regression example and re-derive the predictive distribution by working in terms of distributions over functions y(x, w). This will provide a speci\ufb01c example of a Gaussian process. Consider a model de\ufb01ned in terms of a linear combination of M \ufb01xed basis functions given by the elements of the vector \u03c6(x) so that y(x) = wT\u03c6(x) (6.49) where x is the input vector and w is the M-dimensional weight vector. Now consider a prior distribution over w given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form p(w) = N(w|0, \u03b1\u22121I) (6.50) governed by the hyperparameter \u03b1, which represents the precision (inverse variance) of the distribution. For any given value of w, the de\ufb01nition (6.49) de\ufb01nes a partic- ular function of x. The probability distribution over w de\ufb01ned by (6.50) therefore induces a probability distribution over functions y(x). In practice, we wish to eval- uate this function at speci\ufb01c values of x, for example at the training data points",

We are therefore interested in the joint distribution of the function val- ues y(x1), . . . , y(xN), which we denote by the vector y with elements yn = y(xn) for n = 1, . . . , N. From (6.49), this vector is given by y = \u03a6w (6.51) where \u03a6 is the design matrix with elements \u03a6nk = \u03c6k(xn). We can \ufb01nd the proba- bility distribution of y as follows. First of all we note that y is a linear combination of Gaussian distributed variables given by the elements of w and hence is itself Gaus- sian. We therefore need only to \ufb01nd its mean and covariance, which are given from Exercise 2.31 (6.50) by E[y] = \u03a6E[w] = 0 (6.52) cov[y] = E \b yyT = \u03a6E \b wwT \u03a6T = 1 \u03b1\u03a6\u03a6T = K (6.53) where K is the Gram matrix with elements Knm = k(xn, xm) = 1 \u03b1\u03c6(xn)T\u03c6(xm) (6.54) and k(x, x\u2032) is the kernel function. This model provides us with a particular example of a Gaussian process. In gen- eral, a Gaussian process is de\ufb01ned as a probability distribution over functions y(x) such that the set of values of y(x) evaluated at an arbitrary set of points x1, . . . , xN jointly have a Gaussian distribution. In cases where the input vector x is two di- mensional, this may also be known as a Gaussian random \ufb01eld. More generally, a stochastic process y(x) is speci\ufb01ed by giving the joint probability distribution for any \ufb01nite set of values y(x1), . . . , y(xN) in a consistent manner. A key point about Gaussian stochastic processes is that the joint distribution over N variables y1, . . . , yN is speci\ufb01ed completely by the second-order statistics, namely the mean and the covariance. In most applications, we will not have any prior knowledge about the mean of y(x) and so by symmetry we take it to be zero. This is equivalent to choosing the mean of the prior over weight values p(w|\u03b1) to be zero in the basis function viewpoint. The speci\ufb01cation of the Gaussian process is then completed by giving the covariance of y(x) evaluated at any two values of x, which is given by the kernel function E [y(xn)y(xm)] = k(xn, xm). (6.55) For the speci\ufb01c case of a Gaussian process de\ufb01ned by the linear regression model (6.49) with a weight prior (6.50), the kernel function is given by (6.54). We can also de\ufb01ne the kernel function directly, rather than indirectly through a choice of basis function. Figure 6.4 shows samples of functions drawn from Gaus- sian processes for two different choices of kernel function. The \ufb01rst of these is a \u2018Gaussian\u2019 kernel of the form (6.23), and the second is the exponential kernel given by k(x, x\u2032) = exp (\u2212\u03b8 |x \u2212x\u2032|) (6.56) which corresponds to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process originally introduced by Uh- lenbeck and Ornstein (1930) to describe Brownian motion.",

Because the noise is independent for each data point, the joint distribution of the target values t = (t1, . . . , tN)T conditioned on the values of y = (y1, . . . , yN)T is given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form p(t|y) = N(t|y, \u03b2\u22121IN) (6.59) where IN denotes the N \u00d7N unit matrix. From the de\ufb01nition of a Gaussian process, the marginal distribution p(y) is given by a Gaussian whose mean is zero and whose covariance is de\ufb01ned by a Gram matrix K so that p(y) = N(y|0, K). (6.60) The kernel function that determines K is typically chosen to express the property that, for points xn and xm that are similar, the corresponding values y(xn) and y(xm) will be more strongly correlated than for dissimilar points. Here the notion of similarity will depend on the application. In order to \ufb01nd the marginal distribution p(t), conditioned on the input values x1, . . . , xN, we need to integrate over y. This can be done by making use of the results from Section 2.3.3 for the linear-Gaussian model. Using (2.115), we see that the marginal distribution of t is given by p(t) = \u0006 p(t|y)p(y) dy = N(t|0, C) (6.61)",

So far, we have used the Gaussian process viewpoint to build a model of the joint distribution over sets of data points. Our goal in regression, however, is to make predictions of the target variables for new inputs, given a set of training data. Let us suppose that tN = (t1, . . . , tN)T, corresponding to input values x1, . . . , xN, comprise the observed training set, and our goal is to predict the target variable tN+1 for a new input vector xN+1. This requires that we evaluate the predictive distri- bution p(tN+1|tN). Note that this distribution is conditioned also on the variables x1, . . . , xN and xN+1. However, to keep the notation simple we will not show these conditioning variables explicitly. To \ufb01nd the conditional distribution p(tN+1|t), we begin by writing down the joint distribution p(tN+1), where tN+1 denotes the vector (t1, . . . , tN, tN+1)T. We then apply the results from Section 2.3.1 to obtain the required conditional distribu- tion, as illustrated in Figure 6.7. From (6.61), the joint distribution over t1, . . . , tN+1 will be given by p(tN+1) = N(tN+1|0, CN+1) (6.64) where CN+1 is an (N + 1) \u00d7 (N + 1) covariance matrix with elements given by (6.62).

In practice, rather than \ufb01xing the covariance function, we may prefer to use a parametric family of functions and then infer the parameter values from the data. These parameters govern such things as the length scale of the correlations and the precision of the noise and correspond to the hyperparameters in a standard parametric model. Techniques for learning the hyperparameters are based on the evaluation of the likelihood function p(t|\u03b8) where \u03b8 denotes the hyperparameters of the Gaussian pro- cess model. The simplest approach is to make a point estimate of \u03b8 by maximizing the log likelihood function. Because \u03b8 represents a set of hyperparameters for the regression problem, this can be viewed as analogous to the type 2 maximum like- lihood procedure for linear regression models. Maximization of the log likelihood Section 3.5 can be done using ef\ufb01cient gradient-based optimization algorithms such as conjugate gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). The log likelihood function for a Gaussian process regression model is easily evaluated using the standard form for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, giving ln p(t|\u03b8) = \u22121 2 ln |CN| \u22121 2tTC\u22121 N t \u2212N 2 ln(2\u03c0). (6.69) For nonlinear optimization, we also need the gradient of the log likelihood func- tion with respect to the parameter vector \u03b8. We shall assume that evaluation of the derivatives of CN is straightforward, as would be the case for the covariance func- tions considered in this chapter. Making use of the result (C.21) for the derivative of C\u22121 N , together with the result (C.22) for the derivative of ln |CN|, we obtain \u2202 \u2202\u03b8i ln p(t|\u03b8) = \u22121 2Tr \u000f C\u22121 N \u2202CN \u2202\u03b8i \u0010 + 1 2tTC\u22121 N \u2202CN \u2202\u03b8i C\u22121 N t. (6.70) Because ln p(t|\u03b8) will in general be a nonconvex function, it can have multiple max- ima. It is straightforward to introduce a prior over \u03b8 and to maximize the log poste- rior using gradient-based methods. In a fully Bayesian treatment, we need to evaluate marginals over \u03b8 weighted by the product of the prior p(\u03b8) and the likelihood func- tion p(t|\u03b8). In general, however, exact marginalization will be intractable, and we must resort to approximations. The Gaussian process regression model gives a predictive distribution whose mean and variance are functions of the input vector x. However, we have assumed that the contribution to the predictive variance arising from the additive noise, gov- erned by the parameter \u03b2, is a constant. For some problems, known as heteroscedas- tic, the noise variance itself will also depend on x. To model this, we can extend the",

Gaussian process framework by introducing a second Gaussian process to represent the dependence of \u03b2 on the input x (Goldberg et al., 1998). Because \u03b2 is a variance, and hence nonnegative, we use the Gaussian process to model ln \u03b2(x). 6.4.4 Automatic relevance determination In the previous section, we saw how maximum likelihood could be used to de- termine a value for the correlation length-scale parameter in a Gaussian process. This technique can usefully be extended by incorporating a separate parameter for each input variable (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). The result, as we shall see, is that the optimization of these parameters by maximum likelihood allows the relative importance of different inputs to be inferred from the data. This represents an exam- ple in the Gaussian process context of automatic relevance determination, or ARD, which was originally formulated in the framework of neural networks (MacKay, 1994; Neal, 1996). The mechanism by which appropriate inputs are preferred is discussed in Section 7.2.2. Consider a Gaussian process with a two-dimensional input space x = (x1, x2), having a kernel function of the form k(x, x\u2032) = \u03b80 exp \u0018 \u22121 2 2 \u0002 i=1 \u03b7i(xi \u2212x\u2032 i)2 \u0019 . (6.71) Samples from the resulting prior over functions y(x) are shown for two different settings of the precision parameters \u03b7i in Figure 6.9. We see that, as a particu- lar parameter \u03b7i becomes small, the function becomes relatively insensitive to the corresponding input variable xi. By adapting these parameters to a data set using maximum likelihood, it becomes possible to detect input variables that have little effect on the predictive distribution, because the corresponding values of \u03b7i will be small. This can be useful in practice because it allows such inputs to be discarded. ARD is illustrated using a simple synthetic data set having three inputs x1, x2 and x3 (Nabney, 2002) in Figure 6.10. The target variable t, is generated by sampling 100 values of x1 from a Gaussian, evaluating the function sin(2\u03c0x1), and then adding",

The marginal likelihood for a Gaussian process with ARD parameters \u03b71, \u03b72, \u03b73 is optimized using the scaled conjugate gradients algorithm. We see from Figure 6.10 that \u03b71 converges to a relatively large value, \u03b72 converges to a much smaller value, and \u03b73 becomes very small indicating that x3 is irrelevant for predicting t.

These probabilities must lie in the interval (0, 1), whereas a Gaussian process model makes predictions that lie on the entire real axis. However, we can easily adapt Gaussian processes to classi\ufb01cation problems by transforming the output of the Gaussian process using an appropriate nonlinear activation function. Consider \ufb01rst the two-class problem with a target variable t \u2208{0, 1}. If we de- \ufb01ne a Gaussian process over a function a(x) and then transform the function using a logistic sigmoid y = \u03c3(a), given by (4.59), then we will obtain a non-Gaussian stochastic process over functions y(x) where y \u2208(0, 1).

(6.73) As usual, we denote the training set inputs by x1, . . . , xN with corresponding observed target variables t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. We also consider a single test point xN+1 with target value tN+1. Our goal is to determine the predictive distribution p(tN+1|t), where we have left the conditioning on the input variables implicit. To do this we introduce a Gaussian process prior over the vector aN+1, which has compo- nents a(x1), . . . , a(xN+1). This in turn de\ufb01nes a non-Gaussian process over tN+1, and by conditioning on the training data tN we obtain the required predictive distri- bution. The Gaussian process prior for aN+1 takes the form p(aN+1) = N(aN+1|0, CN+1). (6.74) Unlike the regression case, the covariance matrix no longer includes a noise term because we assume that all of the training data points are correctly labelled. How- ever, for numerical reasons it is convenient to introduce a noise-like term governed by a parameter \u03bd that ensures that the covariance matrix is positive de\ufb01nite. Thus the covariance matrix CN+1 has elements given by C(xn, xm) = k(xn, xm) + \u03bd\u03b4nm (6.75) where k(xn, xm) is any positive semide\ufb01nite kernel function of the kind considered in Section 6.2, and the value of \u03bd is typically \ufb01xed in advance. We shall assume that the kernel function k(x, x\u2032) is governed by a vector \u03b8 of parameters, and we shall later discuss how \u03b8 may be learned from the training data. For two-class problems, it is suf\ufb01cient to predict p(tN+1 = 1|tN) because the value of p(tN+1 = 0|tN) is then given by 1 \u2212p(tN+1 = 1|tN). The required",

This integral is analytically intractable, and so may be approximated using sam- pling methods (Neal, 1997). Alternatively, we can consider techniques based on an analytical approximation. In Section 4.5.2, we derived the approximate formula (4.153) for the convolution of a logistic sigmoid with a Gaussian distribution. We can use this result to evaluate the integral in (6.76) provided we have a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution p(aN+1|tN). The usual justi\ufb01cation for a Gaussian approximation to a posterior distribution is that the true posterior will tend to a Gaussian as the number of data points increases as a consequence of the central limit theorem. In the case of Gaussian processes, the number of variables grows with Section 2.3 the number of data points, and so this argument does not apply directly. However, if we consider increasing the number of data points falling in a \ufb01xed region of x space, then the corresponding uncertainty in the function a(x) will decrease, again leading asymptotically to a Gaussian (Williams and Barber, 1998). Three different approaches to obtaining a Gaussian approximation have been considered. One technique is based on variational inference (Gibbs and MacKay, Section 10.1 2000) and makes use of the local variational bound (10.144) on the logistic sigmoid. This allows the product of sigmoid functions to be approximated by a product of Gaussians thereby allowing the marginalization over aN to be performed analyti- cally. The approach also yields a lower bound on the likelihood function p(tN|\u03b8). The variational framework for Gaussian process classi\ufb01cation can also be extended to multiclass (K > 2) problems by using a Gaussian approximation to the softmax function (Gibbs, 1997). A second approach uses expectation propagation (Opper and Winther, 2000b; Section 10.7 Minka, 2001b; Seeger, 2003). Because the true posterior distribution is unimodal, as we shall see shortly, the expectation propagation approach can give good results. 6.4.6 Laplace approximation The third approach to Gaussian process classi\ufb01cation is based on the Laplace approximation, which we now consider in detail. In order to evaluate the predictive Section 4.4 distribution (6.76), we seek a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution over aN+1, which, using Bayes\u2019 theorem, is given by p(aN+1|tN) = \u0006 p(aN+1, aN|tN) daN = 1 p(tN) \u0006 p(aN+1, aN)p(tN|aN+1, aN) daN = 1 p(tN) \u0006 p(aN+1|aN)p(aN)p(tN|aN) daN = \u0006 p(aN+1|aN)p(aN|tN) daN (6.77)",

(6.78) We can therefore evaluate the integral in (6.77) by \ufb01nding a Laplace approximation for the posterior distribution p(aN|tN), and then using the standard result for the convolution of two Gaussian distributions. The prior p(aN) is given by a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance ma- trix CN, and the data term (assuming independence of the data points) is given by p(tN|aN) = N \u000e n=1 \u03c3(an)tn(1 \u2212\u03c3(an))1\u2212tn = N \u000e n=1 eantn\u03c3(\u2212an). (6.79) We then obtain the Laplace approximation by Taylor expanding the logarithm of p(aN|tN), which up to an additive normalization constant is given by the quantity \u03a8(aN) = ln p(aN) + ln p(tN|aN) = \u22121 2aT NC\u22121 N aN \u2212N 2 ln(2\u03c0) \u22121 2 ln |CN| + tT NaN \u2212 N \u0002 n=1 ln(1 + ean) + const. (6.80) First we need to \ufb01nd the mode of the posterior distribution, and this requires that we evaluate the gradient of \u03a8(aN), which is given by \u2207\u03a8(aN) = tN \u2212\u03c3N \u2212C\u22121 N aN (6.81) where \u03c3N is a vector with elements \u03c3(an). We cannot simply \ufb01nd the mode by setting this gradient to zero, because \u03c3N depends nonlinearly on aN, and so we resort to an iterative scheme based on the Newton-Raphson method, which gives rise to an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. This requires the second Section 4.3.3 derivatives of \u03a8(aN), which we also require for the Laplace approximation anyway, and which are given by \u2207\u2207\u03a8(aN) = \u2212WN \u2212C\u22121 N (6.82) where WN is a diagonal matrix with elements \u03c3(an)(1 \u2212\u03c3(an)), and we have used the result (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function. Note that these diagonal elements lie in the range (0, 1/4), and hence WN is a positive de\ufb01nite matrix. Because CN (and hence its inverse) is positive de\ufb01nite by construction, and because the sum of two positive de\ufb01nite matrices is also positive de\ufb01nite, we see Exercise 6.24 that the Hessian matrix A = \u2212\u2207\u2207\u03a8(aN) is positive de\ufb01nite and so the posterior distribution p(aN|tN) is log convex and therefore has a single mode that is the global",

(6.83) These equations are iterated until they converge to the mode which we denote by a\u22c6 N. At the mode, the gradient \u2207\u03a8(aN) will vanish, and hence a\u22c6 N will satisfy a\u22c6 N = CN(tN \u2212\u03c3N).

As with the Bayesian logistic regression model of Section 4.5, if we are only interested in the decision boundary correspond- ing to p(tN+1|tN) = 0.5, then we need only consider the mean and we can ignore the effect of the variance. We also need to determine the parameters \u03b8 of the covariance function. One approach is to maximize the likelihood function given by p(tN|\u03b8) for which we need expressions for the log likelihood and its gradient. If desired, suitable regularization terms can also be added, leading to a penalized maximum likelihood solution. The likelihood function is de\ufb01ned by p(tN|\u03b8) = \u0006 p(tN|aN)p(aN|\u03b8) daN. (6.89) This integral is analytically intractable, so again we make use of the Laplace approx- imation. Using the result (4.135), we obtain the following approximation for the log of the likelihood function ln p(tN|\u03b8) = \u03a8(a\u22c6 N) \u22121 2 ln |WN + C\u22121 N | + N 2 ln(2\u03c0) (6.90)",

We also need to evaluate the gradient of ln p(tN|\u03b8) with respect to the parameter vector \u03b8. Note that changes in \u03b8 will cause changes in a\u22c6 N, leading to additional terms in the gradient. Thus, when we differentiate (6.90) with respect to \u03b8, we obtain two sets of terms, the \ufb01rst arising from the dependence of the covariance matrix CN on \u03b8, and the rest arising from dependence of a\u22c6 N on \u03b8. The terms arising from the explicit dependence on \u03b8 can be found by using (6.80) together with the results (C.21) and (C.22), and are given by \u2202ln p(tN|\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8j = 1 2a\u22c6T N C\u22121 N \u2202CN \u2202\u03b8j C\u22121 N a\u22c6 N \u22121 2Tr (I + CNWN)\u22121WN \u2202CN \u2202\u03b8j . (6.91) To compute the terms arising from the dependence of a\u22c6 N on \u03b8, we note that the Laplace approximation has been constructed such that \u03a8(aN) has zero gradient at aN = a\u22c6 N, and so \u03a8(a\u22c6 N) gives no contribution to the gradient as a result of its dependence on a\u22c6 N. This leaves the following contribution to the derivative with respect to a component \u03b8j of \u03b8 \u22121 2 N \u0002 n=1 \u2202ln |WN + C\u22121 N | \u2202a\u22c6n \u2202a\u22c6 n \u2202\u03b8j = \u22121 2 N \u0002 n=1 \b (I + CNWN)\u22121CN nn \u03c3\u22c6 n(1 \u2212\u03c3\u22c6 n)(1 \u22122\u03c3\u22c6 n)\u2202a\u22c6 n \u2202\u03b8j (6.92) where \u03c3\u22c6 n = \u03c3(a\u22c6 n), and again we have used the result (C.22) together with the de\ufb01nition of WN. We can evaluate the derivative of a\u22c6 N with respect to \u03b8j by differ- entiating the relation (6.84) with respect to \u03b8j to give \u2202a\u22c6 n \u2202\u03b8j = \u2202CN \u2202\u03b8j (tN \u2212\u03c3N) \u2212CNWN \u2202a\u22c6 n \u2202\u03b8j .

(6.94) Combining (6.91), (6.92), and (6.94), we can evaluate the gradient of the log likelihood function, which can be used with standard nonlinear optimization algo- rithms in order to determine a value for \u03b8. We can illustrate the application of the Laplace approximation for Gaussian pro- cesses using the synthetic two-class data set shown in Figure 6.12. Extension of the Appendix A Laplace approximation to Gaussian processes involving K > 2 classes, using the softmax activation function, is straightforward (Williams and Barber, 1998).",

On the right is the predicted posterior probability for the blue and red classes together with the Gaussian process decision boundary. 6.4.7 Connection to neural networks We have seen that the range of functions which can be represented by a neural network is governed by the number M of hidden units, and that, for suf\ufb01ciently large M, a two-layer network can approximate any given function with arbitrary accuracy. In the framework of maximum likelihood, the number of hidden units needs to be limited (to a level dependent on the size of the training set) in order to avoid over-\ufb01tting. However, from a Bayesian perspective it makes little sense to limit the number of parameters in the network according to the size of the training set. In a Bayesian neural network, the prior distribution over the parameter vector w, in conjunction with the network function f(x, w), produces a prior distribution over functions from y(x) where y is the vector of network outputs. Neal (1996) has shown that, for a broad class of prior distributions over w, the distribution of functions generated by a neural network will tend to a Gaussian process in the limit M \u2192\u221e. It should be noted, however, that in this limit the output variables of the neural network become independent. One of the great merits of neural networks is that the outputs share the hidden units and so they can \u2018borrow statistical strength\u2019 from each other, that is, the weights associated with each hidden unit are in\ufb02uenced by all of the output variables not just by one of them. This property is therefore lost in the Gaussian process limit. We have seen that a Gaussian process is determined by its covariance (kernel) function. Williams (1998) has given explicit forms for the covariance in the case of two speci\ufb01c choices for the hidden unit activation function (probit and Gaussian). These kernel functions k(x, x\u2032) are nonstationary, i.e. they cannot be expressed as a function of the difference x \u2212x\u2032, as a consequence of the Gaussian weight prior being centred on zero which breaks translation invariance in weight space.",

One of the signi\ufb01cant limitations of many such algorithms is that the kernel function k(xn, xm) must be evaluated for all possible pairs xn and xm of training points, which can be computationally infeasible during training and can lead to excessive computation times when making predictions for new data points. In this chapter we shall look at kernel-based algorithms that have sparse solutions, so that predictions for new inputs depend only on the kernel function evaluated at a subset of the training data points. We begin by looking in some detail at the support vector machine (SVM), which became popular in some years ago for solving problems in classi\ufb01cation, regression, and novelty detection.

An alternative sparse kernel technique, known as the relevance vector machine (RVM), is based on a Bayesian formulation and provides posterior proba- Section 7.2 bilistic outputs, as well as having typically much sparser solutions than the SVM. 7.1. Maximum Margin Classi\ufb01ers We begin our discussion of support vector machines by returning to the two-class classi\ufb01cation problem using linear models of the form y(x) = wT\u03c6(x) + b (7.1) where \u03c6(x) denotes a \ufb01xed feature-space transformation, and we have made the bias parameter b explicit. Note that we shall shortly introduce a dual representation expressed in terms of kernel functions, which avoids having to work explicitly in feature space. The training data set comprises N input vectors x1, . . . , xN, with corresponding target values t1, . . . , tN where tn \u2208{\u22121, 1}, and new data points x are classi\ufb01ed according to the sign of y(x). We shall assume for the moment that the training data set is linearly separable in feature space, so that by de\ufb01nition there exists at least one choice of the parameters w and b such that a function of the form (7.1) satis\ufb01es y(xn) > 0 for points having tn = +1 and y(xn) < 0 for points having tn = \u22121, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all training data points. There may of course exist many such solutions that separate the classes exactly. In Section 4.1.7, we described the perceptron algorithm that is guaranteed to \ufb01nd a solution in a \ufb01nite number of steps. The solution that it \ufb01nds, however, will be dependent on the (arbitrary) initial values chosen for w and b as well as on the order in which the data points are presented. If there are multiple solutions all of which classify the training data set exactly, then we should try to \ufb01nd the one that will give the smallest generalization error. The support vector machine approaches this problem through the concept of the margin, which is de\ufb01ned to be the smallest distance between the decision boundary and any of the samples, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. In support vector machines the decision boundary is chosen to be the one for which the margin is maximized. The maximum margin solution can be motivated us- ing computational learning theory, also known as statistical learning theory. How- Section 7.1.5 ever, a simple insight into the origins of maximum margin has been given by Tong and Koller (2000) who consider a framework for classi\ufb01cation based on a hybrid of generative and discriminative approaches.

Maximizing the margin leads to a particular choice of decision boundary, as shown on the right. The location of this boundary is determined by a subset of the data points, known as support vectors, which are indicated by the circles. having a common parameter \u03c32. Together with the class priors, this de\ufb01nes an opti- mal misclassi\ufb01cation-rate decision boundary. However, instead of using this optimal boundary, they determine the best hyperplane by minimizing the probability of error relative to the learned density model. In the limit \u03c32 \u21920, the optimal hyperplane is shown to be the one having maximum margin. The intuition behind this result is that as \u03c32 is reduced, the hyperplane is increasingly dominated by nearby data points relative to more distant ones. In the limit, the hyperplane becomes independent of data points that are not support vectors. We shall see in Figure 10.13 that marginalization with respect to the prior distri- bution of the parameters in a Bayesian approach for a simple linearly separable data set leads to a decision boundary that lies in the middle of the region separating the data points. The large margin solution has similar behaviour. Recall from Figure 4.1 that the perpendicular distance of a point x from a hyper- plane de\ufb01ned by y(x) = 0 where y(x) takes the form (7.1) is given by |y(x)|/\u2225w\u2225.

(7.2) The margin is given by the perpendicular distance to the closest point xn from the data set, and we wish to optimize the parameters w and b in order to maximize this distance.

Direct solution of this optimization problem would be very complex, and so we shall convert it into an equivalent problem that is much easier to solve. To do this we note that if we make the rescaling w \u2192\u03baw and b \u2192\u03bab, then the distance from any point xn to the decision surface, given by tny(xn)/\u2225w\u2225, is unchanged. We can use this freedom to set tn wT\u03c6(xn) + b = 1 (7.4) for the point that is closest to the surface. In this case, all data points will satisfy the constraints tn wT\u03c6(xn) + b \u2a7e1, n = 1, . . . , N. (7.5) This is known as the canonical representation of the decision hyperplane. In the case of data points for which the equality holds, the constraints are said to be active, whereas for the remainder they are said to be inactive. By de\ufb01nition, there will always be at least one active constraint, because there will always be a closest point, and once the margin has been maximized there will be at least two active constraints. The optimization problem then simply requires that we maximize \u2225w\u2225\u22121, which is equivalent to minimizing \u2225w\u22252, and so we have to solve the optimization problem arg min w,b 1 2\u2225w\u22252 (7.6) subject to the constraints given by (7.5).

This is an example of a quadratic programming problem in which we are trying to minimize a quadratic function subject to a set of linear inequality constraints. It appears that the bias parameter b has disappeared from the optimiza- tion. However, it is determined implicitly via the constraints, because these require that changes to \u2225w\u2225be compensated by changes to b. We shall see how this works shortly.

(7.12) Here the kernel function is de\ufb01ned by k(x, x\u2032) = \u03c6(x)T\u03c6(x\u2032). Again, this takes the form of a quadratic programming problem in which we optimize a quadratic function of a subject to a set of inequality constraints. We shall discuss techniques for solving such quadratic programming problems in Section 7.1.1. The solution to a quadratic programming problem in M variables in general has computational complexity that is O(M 3). In going to the dual formulation we have turned the original optimization problem, which involved minimizing (7.6) over M variables, into the dual problem (7.10), which has N variables. For a \ufb01xed set of basis functions whose number M is smaller than the number N of data points, the move to the dual problem appears disadvantageous. However, it allows the model to be reformulated using kernels, and so the maximum margin classi\ufb01er can be applied ef\ufb01ciently to feature spaces whose dimensionality exceeds the number of data points, including in\ufb01nite feature spaces. The kernel formulation also makes clear the role of the constraint that the kernel function k(x, x\u2032) be positive de\ufb01nite, because this ensures that the Lagrangian function \u0004L(a) is bounded below, giving rise to a well- de\ufb01ned optimization problem. In order to classify new data points using the trained model, we evaluate the sign of y(x) de\ufb01ned by (7.1). This can be expressed in terms of the parameters {an} and the kernel function by substituting for w using (7.8) to give y(x) = N \u0002 n=1 antnk(x, xn) + b.

Later he moved to Paris, nar- rowly escaping with his life during the French revo- lution thanks to the personal intervention of Lavoisier (the French chemist who discovered oxygen) who him- self was later executed at the guillotine.

SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES In Appendix E, we show that a constrained optimization of this form satis\ufb01es the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which in this case require that the following three properties hold an \u2a7e 0 (7.14) tny(xn) \u22121 \u2a7e 0 (7.15) an {tny(xn) \u22121} = 0. (7.16) Thus for every data point, either an = 0 or tny(xn) = 1. Any data point for which an = 0 will not appear in the sum in (7.13) and hence plays no role in making predictions for new data points. The remaining data points are called support vectors, and because they satisfy tny(xn) = 1, they correspond to points that lie on the maximum margin hyperplanes in feature space, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. This property is central to the practical applicability of support vector machines. Once the model is trained, a signi\ufb01cant proportion of the data points can be discarded and only the support vectors retained. Having solved the quadratic programming problem and found a value for a, we can then determine the value of the threshold parameter b by noting that any support vector xn satis\ufb01es tny(xn) = 1. Using (7.13) this gives tn \u0016\u0002 m\u2208S amtmk(xn, xm) + b \u0017 = 1 (7.17) where S denotes the set of indices of the support vectors. Although we can solve this equation for b using an arbitrarily chosen support vector xn, a numerically more stable solution is obtained by \ufb01rst multiplying through by tn, making use of t2 n = 1, and then averaging these equations over all support vectors and solving for b to give b = 1 NS \u0002 n\u2208S \u0016 tn \u2212 \u0002 m\u2208S amtmk(xn, xm) \u0017 (7.18) where NS is the total number of support vectors.

Although the data set is not linearly separable in the two-dimensional data space x, it is linearly separable in the nonlinear feature space de\ufb01ned implicitly by the nonlinear kernel function. Thus the training data points are perfectly separated in the original data space. This example also provides a geometrical insight into the origin of sparsity in the SVM. The maximum margin hyperplane is de\ufb01ned by the location of the support vectors. Other data points can be moved around freely (so long as they remain out- side the margin region) without changing the decision boundary, and so the solution will be independent of such data points. 7.1.1 Overlapping class distributions So far, we have assumed that the training data points are linearly separable in the feature space \u03c6(x). The resulting support vector machine will give exact separation of the training data in the original input space x, although the corresponding decision boundary will be nonlinear. In practice, however, the class-conditional distributions may overlap, in which case exact separation of the training data can lead to poor generalization. We therefore need a way to modify the support vector machine so as to allow some of the training points to be misclassi\ufb01ed. From (7.19) we see that in the case of separable classes, we implicitly used an error function that gave in\ufb01nite error if a data point was misclassi\ufb01ed and zero error if it was classi\ufb01ed correctly, and then optimized the model parameters to maximize the margin. We now modify this approach so that data points are allowed to be on the \u2018wrong side\u2019 of the margin boundary, but with a penalty that increases with the distance from that boundary. For the subsequent optimization problem, it is convenient to make this penalty a linear function of this distance. To do this, we introduce slack variables, \u03ben \u2a7e0 where n = 1, . . . , N, with one slack variable for each training data point (Bennett, 1992; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). These are de\ufb01ned by \u03ben = 0 for data points that are on or inside the correct margin boundary and \u03ben = |tn \u2212y(xn)| for other points. Thus a data point that is on the decision boundary y(xn) = 0 will have \u03ben = 1, and points",

This is sometimes described as relaxing the hard margin constraint to give a soft margin and allows some of the training set data points to be misclassi\ufb01ed. Note that while slack variables allow for overlapping class distributions, this framework is still sensitive to outliers because the penalty for misclassi\ufb01cation increases linearly with \u03be.

We \ufb01rst note that the objective function \u0004L(a) given by (7.10) or (7.32) is quadratic and so any local optimum will also be a global optimum provided the constraints de\ufb01ne a convex region (which they do as a conse- quence of being linear). Direct solution of the quadratic programming problem us- ing traditional techniques is often infeasible due to the demanding computation and memory requirements, and so more practical approaches need to be found. The tech- nique of chunking (Vapnik, 1982) exploits the fact that the value of the Lagrangian is unchanged if we remove the rows and columns of the kernel matrix corresponding to Lagrange multipliers that have value zero. This allows the full quadratic pro- gramming problem to be broken down into a series of smaller ones, whose goal is eventually to identify all of the nonzero Lagrange multipliers and discard the others. Chunking can be implemented using protected conjugate gradients (Burges, 1998). Although chunking reduces the size of the matrix in the quadratic function from the number of data points squared to approximately the number of nonzero Lagrange multipliers squared, even this may be too big to \ufb01t in memory for large-scale appli- cations. Decomposition methods (Osuna et al., 1996) also solve a series of smaller quadratic programming problems but are designed so that each of these is of a \ufb01xed size, and so the technique can be applied to arbitrarily large data sets. However, it still involves numerical solution of quadratic programming subproblems and these can be problematic and expensive. One of the most popular approaches to training support vector machines is called sequential minimal optimization, or SMO (Platt, 1999). It takes the concept of chunking to the extreme limit and considers just two Lagrange multipliers at a time. In this case, the subproblem can be solved analyti- cally, thereby avoiding numerical quadratic programming altogether. Heuristics are given for choosing the pair of Lagrange multipliers to be considered at each step. In practice, SMO is found to have a scaling with the number of data points that is somewhere between linear and quadratic depending on the particular application. We have seen that kernel functions correspond to inner products in feature spaces that can have high, or even in\ufb01nite, dimensionality. By working directly in terms of the kernel function, without introducing the feature space explicitly, it might there- fore seem that support vector machines somehow manage to avoid the curse of di-",

This is not the case, however, because there are constraints amongst Section 1.4 the feature values that restrict the effective dimensionality of feature space. To see this consider a simple second-order polynomial kernel that we can expand in terms of its components k(x, z) = 1 + xTz 2 = (1 + x1z1 + x2z2)2 = 1 + 2x1z1 + 2x2z2 + x2 1z2 1 + 2x1z1x2z2 + x2 2z2 2 = (1, \u221a 2x1, \u221a 2x2, x2 1, \u221a 2x1x2, x2 2)(1, \u221a 2z1, \u221a 2z2, z2 1, \u221a 2z1z2, z2 2)T = \u03c6(x)T\u03c6(z). (7.42) This kernel function therefore represents an inner product in a feature space having six dimensions, in which the mapping from input space to feature space is described by the vector function \u03c6(x). However, the coef\ufb01cients weighting these different features are constrained to have speci\ufb01c forms. Thus any set of points in the original two-dimensional space x would be constrained to lie exactly on a two-dimensional nonlinear manifold embedded in the six-dimensional feature space. We have already highlighted the fact that the support vector machine does not provide probabilistic outputs but instead makes classi\ufb01cation decisions for new in- put vectors. Veropoulos et al. (1999) discuss modi\ufb01cations to the SVM to allow the trade-off between false positive and false negative errors to be controlled. How- ever, if we wish to use the SVM as a module in a larger probabilistic system, then probabilistic predictions of the class label t for new inputs x are required. To address this issue, Platt (2000) has proposed \ufb01tting a logistic sigmoid to the outputs of a previously trained support vector machine. Speci\ufb01cally, the required conditional probability is assumed to be of the form p(t = 1|x) = \u03c3 (Ay(x) + B) (7.43) where y(x) is de\ufb01ned by (7.1). Values for the parameters A and B are found by minimizing the cross-entropy error function de\ufb01ned by a training set consisting of pairs of values y(xn) and tn. The data used to \ufb01t the sigmoid needs to be independent of that used to train the original SVM in order to avoid severe over-\ufb01tting. This two- stage approach is equivalent to assuming that the output y(x) of the support vector machine represents the log-odds of x belonging to class t = 1. Because the SVM training procedure is not speci\ufb01cally intended to encourage this, the SVM can give a poor approximation to the posterior probabilities (Tipping, 2001). 7.1.2 Relation to logistic regression As with the separable case, we can re-cast the SVM for nonseparable distri- butions in terms of the minimization of a regularized error function. This will also allow us to highlight similarities, and differences, compared to the logistic regression model.

The hinge error function, so-called because of its shape, is plotted in Figure 7.5. It can be viewed as an approximation to the misclassi\ufb01cation error, i.e., the error function that ideally we would like to minimize, which is also shown in Figure 7.5. When we considered the logistic regression model in Section 4.3.2, we found it convenient to work with target variable t \u2208{0, 1}. For comparison with the support vector machine, we \ufb01rst reformulate maximum likelihood logistic regression using the target variable t \u2208{\u22121, 1}. To do this, we note that p(t = 1|y) = \u03c3(y) where y(x) is given by (7.1), and \u03c3(y) is the logistic sigmoid function de\ufb01ned by (4.59). It follows that p(t = \u22121|y) = 1 \u2212\u03c3(y) = \u03c3(\u2212y), where we have used the properties of the logistic sigmoid function, and so we can write p(t|y) = \u03c3(yt).

This rescaled error function is also plotted in Figure 7.5 and we see that it has a similar form to the support vector error function. The key difference is that the \ufb02at region in ESV(yt) leads to sparse solutions. Both the logistic error and the hinge loss can be viewed as continuous approx- imations to the misclassi\ufb01cation error. Another continuous error function that has sometimes been used to solve classi\ufb01cation problems is the squared error, which is again plotted in Figure 7.5. It has the property, however, of placing increasing emphasis on data points that are correctly classi\ufb01ed but that are a long way from the decision boundary on the correct side. Such points will be strongly weighted at the expense of misclassi\ufb01ed points, and so if the objective is to minimize the mis- classi\ufb01cation rate, then a monotonically decreasing error function would be a better choice. 7.1.3 Multiclass SVMs The support vector machine is fundamentally a two-class classi\ufb01er. In practice, however, we often have to tackle problems involving K > 2 classes. Various meth- ods have therefore been proposed for combining multiple two-class SVMs in order to build a multiclass classi\ufb01er. One commonly used approach (Vapnik, 1998) is to construct K separate SVMs, in which the kth model yk(x) is trained using the data from class Ck as the positive examples and the data from the remaining K \u22121 classes as the negative examples. This is known as the one-versus-the-rest approach. However, in Figure 4.2 we saw that using the decisions of the individual classi\ufb01ers can lead to inconsistent results in which an input is assigned to multiple classes simultaneously. This problem is sometimes addressed by making predictions for new inputs x using y(x) = max k yk(x). (7.49) Unfortunately, this heuristic approach suffers from the problem that the different classi\ufb01ers were trained on different tasks, and there is no guarantee that the real- valued quantities yk(x) for different classi\ufb01ers will have appropriate scales. Another problem with the one-versus-the-rest approach is that the training sets are imbalanced. For instance, if we have ten classes each with equal numbers of training data points, then the individual classi\ufb01ers are trained on data sets comprising 90% negative examples and only 10% positive examples, and the symmetry of the original problem is lost. A variant of the one-versus-the-rest scheme was proposed by Lee et al. (2001) who modify the target values so that the positive class has target +1 and the negative class has target \u22121/(K \u22121). Weston and Watkins (1999) de\ufb01ne a single objective function for training all K SVMs simultaneously, based on maximizing the margin from each to remaining classes. However, this can result in much slower training because, instead of solving K separate optimization problems each over N data points with an overall cost of O(KN 2), a single optimization problem of size (K \u22121)N must be solved giving an overall cost of O(K2N 2).",

Maximum Margin Classi\ufb01ers 339 Another approach is to train K(K \u22121)/2 different 2-class SVMs on all possible pairs of classes, and then to classify test points according to which class has the high- est number of \u2018votes\u2019, an approach that is sometimes called one-versus-one. Again, we saw in Figure 4.2 that this can lead to ambiguities in the resulting classi\ufb01cation. Also, for large K this approach requires signi\ufb01cantly more training time than the one-versus-the-rest approach. Similarly, to evaluate test points, signi\ufb01cantly more computation is required. The latter problem can be alleviated by organizing the pairwise classi\ufb01ers into a directed acyclic graph (not to be confused with a probabilistic graphical model) leading to the DAGSVM (Platt et al., 2000). For K classes, the DAGSVM has a total of K(K \u22121)/2 classi\ufb01ers, and to classify a new test point only K \u22121 pairwise classi\ufb01ers need to be evaluated, with the particular classi\ufb01ers used depending on which path through the graph is traversed. A different approach to multiclass classi\ufb01cation, based on error-correcting out- put codes, was developed by Dietterich and Bakiri (1995) and applied to support vector machines by Allwein et al. (2000). This can be viewed as a generalization of the voting scheme of the one-versus-one approach in which more general partitions of the classes are used to train the individual classi\ufb01ers. The K classes themselves are represented as particular sets of responses from the two-class classi\ufb01ers chosen, and together with a suitable decoding scheme, this gives robustness to errors and to ambiguity in the outputs of the individual classi\ufb01ers. Although the application of SVMs to multiclass classi\ufb01cation problems remains an open issue, in practice the one-versus-the-rest approach is the most widely used in spite of its ad-hoc formula- tion and its practical limitations. There are also single-class support vector machines, which solve an unsuper- vised learning problem related to probability density estimation. Instead of mod- elling the density of data, however, these methods aim to \ufb01nd a smooth boundary enclosing a region of high density. The boundary is chosen to represent a quantile of the density, that is, the probability that a data point drawn from the distribution will land inside that region is given by a \ufb01xed number between 0 and 1 that is speci\ufb01ed in advance. This is a more restricted problem than estimating the full density but may be suf\ufb01cient in speci\ufb01c applications. Two approaches to this problem using support vector machines have been proposed. The algorithm of Sch\u00a8olkopf et al. (2001) tries to \ufb01nd a hyperplane that separates all but a \ufb01xed fraction \u03bd of the training data from the origin while at the same time maximizing the distance (margin) of the hyperplane from the origin, while Tax and Duin (1999) look for the smallest sphere in feature space that contains all but a fraction \u03bd of the data points. For kernels k(x, x\u2032) that are functions only of x \u2212x\u2032, the two algorithms are equivalent. 7.1.4 SVMs for regression We now extend support vector machines to regression problems while at the same time preserving the property of sparseness.

A simple example of an \u03f5-insensitive error function, having a linear cost associated with errors outside the insensitive region, is given by E\u03f5(y(x) \u2212t) = 0, if |y(x) \u2212t| < \u03f5; |y(x) \u2212t| \u2212\u03f5, otherwise (7.51) and is illustrated in Figure 7.6.

Also \u00b5n \u2a7e0 and \u0001\u00b5n \u2a7e0 together with (7.59) and (7.60), require an \u2a7dC and \u0001an \u2a7dC, and so again we have the box constraints 0 \u2a7dan \u2a7dC (7.62) 0 \u2a7d\u0001an \u2a7dC (7.63) together with the condition (7.58).

(7.68) From these we can obtain several useful results. First of all, we note that a coef\ufb01cient an can only be nonzero if \u03f5 + \u03ben + yn \u2212tn = 0, which implies that the data point either lies on the upper boundary of the \u03f5-tube (\u03ben = 0) or lies above the upper boundary (\u03ben > 0). Similarly, a nonzero value for \u0001an implies \u03f5 +\u0001\u03ben \u2212yn + tn = 0, and such points must lie either on or below the lower boundary of the \u03f5-tube. Furthermore, the two constraints \u03f5+\u03ben +yn \u2212tn = 0 and \u03f5+\u0001\u03ben \u2212yn +tn = 0 are incompatible, as is easily seen by adding them together and noting that \u03ben and \u0001\u03ben are nonnegative while \u03f5 is strictly positive, and so for every data point xn, either an or \u0001an (or both) must be zero. The support vectors are those data points that contribute to predictions given by (7.64), in other words those for which either an \u0338= 0 or \u0001an \u0338= 0. These are points that lie on the boundary of the \u03f5-tube or outside the tube. All points within the tube have",

The parameter b can be found by considering a data point for which 0 < an < C, which from (7.67) must have \u03ben = 0, and from (7.65) must therefore satisfy \u03f5 + yn \u2212tn = 0.

We can obtain an analogous result by considering a point for which 0 < \u0001an < C. In practice, it is better to average over all such estimates of b. As with the classi\ufb01cation case, there is an alternative formulation of the SVM for regression in which the parameter governing complexity has a more intuitive interpretation (Sch\u00a8olkopf et al., 2000).

This has its origins with Valiant (1984) who formulated the probably approximately correct, or PAC, learning framework. The goal of the PAC framework is to understand how large a data set needs to be in order to give good generalization. It also gives bounds for the computational cost of learning, although we do not consider these here. Suppose that a data set D of size N is drawn from some joint distribution p(x, t) where x is the input variable and t represents the class label, and that we restrict attention to \u2018noise free\u2019 situations in which the class labels are determined by some (unknown) deterministic function t = g(x). In PAC learning we say that a function f(x; D), drawn from a space F of such functions on the basis of the training set D, has good generalization if its expected error rate is below some pre-speci\ufb01ed threshold \u03f5, so that Ex,t [I (f(x; D) \u0338= t)] < \u03f5 (7.75) where I(\u00b7) is the indicator function, and the expectation is with respect to the dis- tribution p(x, t). The quantity on the left-hand side is a random variable, because it depends on the training set D, and the PAC framework requires that (7.75) holds, with probability greater than 1 \u2212\u03b4, for a data set D drawn randomly from p(x, t). Here \u03b4 is another pre-speci\ufb01ed parameter, and the terminology \u2018probably approxi- mately correct\u2019 comes from the requirement that with high probability (greater than 1\u2212\u03b4), the error rate be small (less than \u03f5). For a given choice of model space F, and for given parameters \u03f5 and \u03b4, PAC learning aims to provide bounds on the minimum size N of data set needed to meet this criterion. A key quantity in PAC learning is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension, which provides a measure of the complexity of a space of functions, and which allows the PAC framework to be extended to spaces containing an in\ufb01nite number of functions. The bounds derived within the PAC framework are often described as worst-",

In real-world applications of machine learning, we deal with distributions that have signi\ufb01cant reg- ularity, for example in which large regions of input space carry the same class label. As a consequence of the lack of any assumptions about the form of the distribution, the PAC bounds are very conservative, in other words they strongly over-estimate the size of data sets required to achieve a given generalization performance. For this reason, PAC bounds have found few, if any, practical applications. One attempt to improve the tightness of the PAC bounds is the PAC-Bayesian framework (McAllester, 2003), which considers a distribution over the space F of functions, somewhat analogous to the prior in a Bayesian treatment. This still con- siders any possible choice for p(x, t), and so although the bounds are tighter, they are still very conservative. 7.2. Relevance Vector Machines Support vector machines have been used in a variety of classi\ufb01cation and regres- sion applications. Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of limitations, several of which have been highlighted already in this chapter. In particular, the outputs of an SVM represent decisions rather than posterior probabilities. Also, the SVM was originally formulated for two classes, and the extension to K > 2 classes is prob- lematic. There is a complexity parameter C, or \u03bd (as well as a parameter \u03f5 in the case of regression), that must be found using a hold-out method such as cross-validation. Finally, predictions are expressed as linear combinations of kernel functions that are centred on training data points and that are required to be positive de\ufb01nite. The relevance vector machine or RVM (Tipping, 2001) is a Bayesian sparse ker- nel technique for regression and classi\ufb01cation that shares many of the characteristics of the SVM whilst avoiding its principal limitations. Additionally, it typically leads to much sparser models resulting in correspondingly faster performance on test data whilst maintaining comparable generalization error. In contrast to the SVM we shall \ufb01nd it more convenient to introduce the regres- sion form of the RVM \ufb01rst and then consider the extension to classi\ufb01cation tasks. 7.2.1 RVM for regression The relevance vector machine for regression is a linear model of the form studied in Chapter 3 but with a modi\ufb01ed prior that results in sparse solutions. The model de\ufb01nes a conditional distribution for a real-valued target variable t, given an input vector x, which takes the form p(t|x, w, \u03b2) = N(t|y(x), \u03b2\u22121) (7.76)",

The relevance vector machine is a speci\ufb01c instance of this model, which is in- tended to mirror the structure of the support vector machine. In particular, the basis functions are given by kernels, with one kernel associated with each of the data points from the training set. The general expression (7.77) then takes the SVM-like form y(x) = N \u0002 n=1 wnk(x, xn) + b (7.78) where b is a bias parameter. The number of parameters in this case is M = N + 1, and y(x) has the same form as the predictive model (7.64) for the SVM, except that the coef\ufb01cients an are here denoted wn. It should be emphasized that the subsequent analysis is valid for arbitrary choices of basis function, and for generality we shall work with the form (7.77). In contrast to the SVM, there is no restriction to positive- de\ufb01nite kernels, nor are the basis functions tied in either number or location to the training data points. Suppose we are given a set of N observations of the input vector x, which we denote collectively by a data matrix X whose nth row is xT n with n = 1, . . . , N. The corresponding target values are given by t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. Thus, the likelihood function is given by p(t|X, w, \u03b2) = N \u000e n=1 p(tn|xn, w, \u03b2\u22121). (7.79) Next we introduce a prior distribution over the parameter vector w and as in Chapter 3, we shall consider a zero-mean Gaussian prior. However, the key differ- ence in the RVM is that we introduce a separate hyperparameter \u03b1i for each of the weight parameters wi instead of a single shared hyperparameter. Thus the weight prior takes the form p(w|\u03b1) = M \u000e i=1 N(wi|0, \u03b1\u22121 i ) (7.80) where \u03b1i represents the precision of the corresponding parameter wi, and \u03b1 denotes (\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1M)T. We shall see that, when we maximize the evidence with respect to these hyperparameters, a signi\ufb01cant proportion of them go to in\ufb01nity, and the corresponding weight parameters have posterior distributions that are concentrated at zero. The basis functions associated with these parameters therefore play no role",

Learning therefore proceeds by choosing initial values for \u03b1 and \u03b2, evalu- ating the mean and covariance of the posterior using (7.82) and (7.83), respectively, and then alternately re-estimating the hyperparameters, using (7.87) and (7.88), and re-estimating the posterior mean and covariance, using (7.82) and (7.83), until a suit- able convergence criterion is satis\ufb01ed. The second approach is to use the EM algorithm, and is discussed in Sec- tion 9.3.4. These two approaches to \ufb01nding the values of the hyperparameters that maximize the evidence are formally equivalent. Numerically, however, it is found Exercise 9.23 that the direct optimization approach corresponding to (7.87) and (7.88) gives some- what faster convergence (Tipping, 2001). As a result of the optimization, we \ufb01nd that a proportion of the hyperparameters {\u03b1i} are driven to large (in principle in\ufb01nite) values, and so the weight parameters Section 7.2.2 wi corresponding to these hyperparameters have posterior distributions with mean and variance both zero. Thus those parameters, and the corresponding basis func- tions \u03c6i(x), are removed from the model and play no role in making predictions for new inputs. In the case of models of the form (7.78), the inputs xn corresponding to the remaining nonzero weights are called relevance vectors, because they are iden- ti\ufb01ed through the mechanism of automatic relevance determination, and are analo- gous to the support vectors of an SVM. It is worth emphasizing, however, that this mechanism for achieving sparsity in probabilistic models through automatic rele- vance determination is quite general and can be applied to any model expressed as an adaptive linear combination of basis functions. Having found values \u03b1\u22c6and \u03b2\u22c6for the hyperparameters that maximize the marginal likelihood, we can evaluate the predictive distribution over t for a new input x. Using (7.76) and (7.81), this is given by Exercise 7.14 p(t|x, X, t, \u03b1\u22c6, \u03b2\u22c6) = \u0006 p(t|x, w, \u03b2\u22c6)p(w|X, t, \u03b1\u22c6, \u03b2\u22c6) dw = N t|mT\u03c6(x), \u03c32(x) . (7.90) Thus the predictive mean is given by (7.76) with w set equal to the posterior mean m, and the variance of the predictive distribution is given by \u03c32(x) = (\u03b2\u22c6)\u22121 + \u03c6(x)T\u03a3\u03c6(x) (7.91) where \u03a3 is given by (7.83) in which \u03b1 and \u03b2 are set to their optimized values \u03b1\u22c6and \u03b2\u22c6. This is just the familiar result (3.59) obtained in the context of linear regression. Recall that for localized basis functions, the predictive variance for linear regression models becomes small in regions of input space where there are no basis functions. In the case of an RVM with the basis functions centred on data points, the model will therefore become increasingly certain of its predictions when extrapolating outside the domain of the data (Rasmussen and Qui\u02dcnonero-Candela, 2005), which of course is undesirable.

However, the computational cost of making predictions with a Gaussian processes is typically much higher than with an RVM. Figure 7.9 shows an example of the RVM applied to the sinusoidal regression data set. Here the noise precision parameter \u03b2 is also determined through evidence maximization. We see that the number of relevance vectors in the RVM is signif- icantly smaller than the number of support vectors used by the SVM. For a wide range of regression and classi\ufb01cation tasks, the RVM is found to give models that are typically an order of magnitude more compact than the corresponding support vector machine, resulting in a signi\ufb01cant improvement in the speed of processing on test data. Remarkably, this greater sparsity is achieved with little or no reduction in generalization error compared with the corresponding SVM. The principal disadvantage of the RVM compared to the SVM is that training involves optimizing a nonconvex function, and training times can be longer than for a comparable SVM. For a model with M basis functions, the RVM requires inversion of a matrix of size M \u00d7 M, which in general requires O(M 3) computation. In the speci\ufb01c case of the SVM-like model (7.78), we have M = N +1. As we have noted, there are techniques for training SVMs whose cost is roughly quadratic in N. Of course, in the case of the RVM we always have the option of starting with a smaller number of basis functions than N + 1. More signi\ufb01cantly, in the relevance vector machine the parameters governing complexity and noise variance are determined automatically from a single training run, whereas in the support vector machine the parameters C and \u03f5 (or \u03bd) are generally found using cross-validation, which involves multiple training runs. Furthermore, in the next section we shall derive an alternative procedure for training the relevance vector machine that improves training speed signi\ufb01cantly. 7.2.2 Analysis of sparsity We have noted earlier that the mechanism of automatic relevance determination causes a subset of parameters to be driven to zero.

In the process, we will arrive at a signi\ufb01cantly faster procedure for optimizing the hyper- parameters compared to the direct techniques given above. Before proceeding with a mathematical analysis, we \ufb01rst give some informal insight into the origin of sparsity in Bayesian linear models. Consider a data set comprising N = 2 observations t1 and t2, together with a model having a single basis function \u03c6(x), with hyperparameter \u03b1, along with isotropic noise having pre- cision \u03b2. From (7.85), the marginal likelihood is given by p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2) = N(t|0, C) in which the covariance matrix takes the form C = 1 \u03b2 I + 1 \u03b1\u03d5\u03d5T (7.92) where \u03d5 denotes the N-dimensional vector (\u03c6(x1), \u03c6(x2))T, and similarly t = (t1, t2)T. Notice that this is just a zero-mean Gaussian process model over t with covariance C. Given a particular observation for t, our goal is to \ufb01nd \u03b1\u22c6and \u03b2\u22c6by maximizing the marginal likelihood. We see from Figure 7.10 that, if there is a poor alignment between the direction of \u03d5 and that of the training data vector t, then the corresponding hyperparameter \u03b1 will be driven to \u221e, and the basis vector will be pruned from the model. This arises because any \ufb01nite value for \u03b1 will always assign a lower probability to the data, thereby decreasing the value of the density at t, pro- vided that \u03b2 is set to its optimal value. We see that any \ufb01nite value for \u03b1 would cause the distribution to be elongated in a direction away from the data, thereby increasing the probability mass in regions away from the observed data and hence reducing the value of the density at the target data vector itself.

We now investigate the mechanism for sparsity from a more mathematical per- spective, for a general case involving M basis functions. To motivate this analysis we \ufb01rst note that, in the result (7.87) for re-estimating the parameter \u03b1i, the terms on the right-hand side are themselves also functions of \u03b1i. These results therefore rep- resent implicit solutions, and iteration would be required even to determine a single \u03b1i with all other \u03b1j for j \u0338= i \ufb01xed. This suggests a different approach to solving the optimization problem for the RVM, in which we make explicit all of the dependence of the marginal likelihood (7.85) on a particular \u03b1i and then determine its stationary points explicitly (Faul and Tipping, 2002; Tipping and Faul, 2003). To do this, we \ufb01rst pull out the contribution from \u03b1i in the matrix C de\ufb01ned by (7.86) to give C = \u03b2\u22121I + \u0002 j\u0338=i \u03b1\u22121 j \u03d5j\u03d5T j + \u03b1\u22121 i \u03d5i\u03d5T i = C\u2212i + \u03b1\u22121 i \u03d5i\u03d5T i (7.93) where \u03d5i denotes the ith column of \u03a6, in other words the N-dimensional vector with elements (\u03c6i(x1), . . . , \u03c6i(xN)), in contrast to \u03c6n, which denotes the nth row of \u03a6. The matrix C\u2212i represents the matrix C with the contribution from basis function i removed. Using the matrix identities (C.7) and (C.15), the determinant and inverse of C can then be written |C| = |C\u2212i||1 + \u03b1\u22121 i \u03d5T i C\u22121 \u2212i\u03d5i| (7.94) C\u22121 = C\u22121 \u2212i \u2212C\u22121 \u2212i\u03d5i\u03d5T i C\u22121 \u2212i \u03b1i + \u03d5T i C\u22121 \u2212i\u03d5i . (7.95) Using these results, we can then write the log marginal likelihood function (7.85) in the form Exercise 7.15 L(\u03b1) = L(\u03b1\u2212i) + \u03bb(\u03b1i) (7.96) where L(\u03b1\u2212i) is simply the log marginal likelihood with basis function \u03d5i omitted, and the quantity \u03bb(\u03b1i) is de\ufb01ned by \u03bb(\u03b1i) = 1 2 ln \u03b1i \u2212ln (\u03b1i + si) + q2 i \u03b1i + si (7.97) and contains all of the dependence on \u03b1i.

Conversely, if q2 i > si, we can solve for \u03b1i to obtain \u03b1i = s2 i q2 i \u2212si . (7.101) These two solutions are illustrated in Figure 7.11. We see that the relative size of the quality and sparsity terms determines whether a particular basis vector will be pruned from the model or not. A more complete analysis (Faul and Tipping, 2002), based on the second derivatives of the marginal likelihood, con\ufb01rms these solutions are indeed the unique maxima of \u03bb(\u03b1i). Exercise 7.16 Note that this approach has yielded a closed-form solution for \u03b1i, for given values of the other hyperparameters. As well as providing insight into the origin of sparsity in the RVM, this analysis also leads to a practical algorithm for optimizing the hyperparameters that has signi\ufb01cant speed advantages. This uses a \ufb01xed set of candidate basis vectors, and then cycles through them in turn to decide whether each vector should be included in the model or not.

If we introduce a Gaussian prior over the weight vector w, then we obtain the model that has been considered already in Chapter 4. The difference here is that in the RVM, this model uses the ARD prior (7.80) in which there is a separate precision hyperparameter associated with each weight parameter. In contrast to the regression model, we can no longer integrate analytically over the parameter vector w. Here we follow Tipping (2001) and use the Laplace ap- proximation, which was applied to the closely related problem of Bayesian logistic Section 4.4 regression in Section 4.5.1. We begin by initializing the hyperparameter vector \u03b1. For this given value of \u03b1, we then build a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution and thereby obtain an approximation to the marginal likelihood. Maximization of this approxi- mate marginal likelihood then leads to a re-estimated value for \u03b1, and the process is repeated until convergence. Let us consider the Laplace approximation for this model in more detail. For a \ufb01xed value of \u03b1, the mode of the posterior distribution over w is obtained by maximizing ln p(w|t, \u03b1) = ln {p(t|w)p(w|\u03b1)} \u2212ln p(t|\u03b1) = N \u0002 n=1 {tn ln yn + (1 \u2212tn) ln(1 \u2212yn)} \u22121 2wTAw + const (7.109) where A = diag(\u03b1i). This can be done using iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) as discussed in Section 4.3.3. For this, we need the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the log posterior distribution, which from (7.109) are given by Exercise 7.18 \u2207ln p(w|t, \u03b1) = \u03a6T(t \u2212y) \u2212Aw (7.110) \u2207\u2207ln p(w|t, \u03b1) = \u2212 \u03a6TB\u03a6 + A (7.111) where B is an N \u00d7 N diagonal matrix with elements bn = yn(1 \u2212yn), the vector y = (y1, . . . , yN)T, and \u03a6 is the design matrix with elements \u03a6ni = \u03c6i(xn). Here we have used the property (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function. At convergence of the IRLS algorithm, the negative Hessian represents the inverse covariance matrix for the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. The mode of the resulting approximation to the posterior distribution, corre- sponding to the mean of the Gaussian approximation, is obtained setting (7.110) to zero, giving the mean and covariance of the Laplace approximation in the form w\u22c6 = A\u22121\u03a6T(t \u2212y) (7.112) \u03a3 = \u03a6TB\u03a6 + A \u22121 .

(7.119) This takes the same form as (7.85) in the regression case, and so we can apply the same analysis of sparsity and obtain the same fast learning algorithm in which we fully optimize a single hyperparameter \u03b1i at each step. Figure 7.12 shows the relevance vector machine applied to a synthetic classi\ufb01- cation data set. We see that the relevance vectors tend not to lie in the region of the Appendix A decision boundary, in contrast to the support vector machine. This is consistent with our earlier discussion of sparsity in the RVM, because a basis function \u03c6i(x) centred on a data point near the boundary will have a vector \u03d5i that is poorly aligned with the training data vector t. One of the potential advantages of the relevance vector machine compared with the SVM is that it makes probabilistic predictions. For example, this allows the RVM to be used to help construct an emission density in a nonlinear extension of the linear dynamical system for tracking faces in video sequences (Williams et al., 2005).

This gives a more principled approach to multiclass classi\ufb01cation than the pairwise method used in the support vector machine and also provides probabilis- tic predictions for new data points. The principal disadvantage is that the Hessian matrix has size MK \u00d7MK, where M is the number of active basis functions, which gives an additional factor of K3 in the computational cost of training compared with the two-class RVM. The principal disadvantage of the relevance vector machine is the relatively long training times compared with the SVM. This is offset, however, by the avoidance of cross-validation runs to set the model complexity parameters. Furthermore, because it yields sparser models, the computation time on test points, which is usually the more important consideration in practice, is typically much less.",

We could therefore proceed to formulate and solve complicated probabilistic models purely by algebraic ma- nipulation. However, we shall \ufb01nd it highly advantageous to augment the analysis using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called probabilistic graphical models. These offer several useful properties: 1. They provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model and can be used to design and motivate new models. 2.

Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophis- ticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly. A graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known as edges or arcs). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relation- ships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of factors each depending only on a subset of the variables. We shall begin by dis- cussing Bayesian networks, also known as directed graphical models, in which the links of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other major class of graphical models are Markov random \ufb01elds, also known as undirected graphical models, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional signi\ufb01cance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between random variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft con- straints between random variables. For the purposes of solving inference problems, it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different representation called a factor graph. In this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed for applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. More general treat- ments of graphical models can be found in the books by Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen (1996), Jensen (1996), Castillo et al. (1997), Jordan (1999), Cowell et al. (1999), and Jordan (2007). 8.1. Bayesian Networks In order to motivate the use of directed graphs to describe probability distributions, consider \ufb01rst an arbitrary joint distribution p(a, b, c) over three variables a, b, and c. Note that at this stage, we do not need to specify anything further about these vari- ables, such as whether they are discrete or continuous. Indeed, one of the powerful aspects of graphical models is that a speci\ufb01c graph can make probabilistic statements for a broad class of distributions. By application of the product rule of probability (1.11), we can write the joint distribution in the form p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(a, b). (8.1) A second application of the product rule, this time to the second term on the right- hand side of (8.1), gives p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(b|a)p(a). (8.2) Note that this decomposition holds for any choice of the joint distribution. We now represent the right-hand side of (8.2) in terms of a simple graphical model as follows. First we introduce a node for each of the random variables a, b, and c and associate each node with the corresponding conditional distribution on the right-hand side of",

Bayesian Networks 361 Figure 8.1 A directed graphical model representing the joint probabil- ity distribution over three variables a, b, and c, correspond- ing to the decomposition on the right-hand side of (8.2). a b c (8.2). Then, for each conditional distribution we add directed links (arrows) to the graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on which the distribution is conditioned. Thus for the factor p(c|a, b), there will be links from nodes a and b to node c, whereas for the factor p(a) there will be no incoming links. The result is the graph shown in Figure 8.1. If there is a link going from a node a to a node b, then we say that node a is the parent of node b, and we say that node b is the child of node a. Note that we shall not make any formal distinction between a node and the variable to which it corresponds but will simply use the same symbol to refer to both. An interesting point to note about (8.2) is that the left-hand side is symmetrical with respect to the three variables a, b, and c, whereas the right-hand side is not. Indeed, in making the decomposition in (8.2), we have implicitly chosen a particular ordering, namely a, b, c, and had we chosen a different ordering we would have obtained a different decomposition and hence a different graphical representation. We shall return to this point later. For the moment let us extend the example of Figure 8.1 by considering the joint distribution over K variables given by p(x1, . . . , xK). By repeated application of the product rule of probability, this joint distribution can be written as a product of conditional distributions, one for each of the variables p(x1, . . . , xK) = p(xK|x1, . . . , xK\u22121) . . . p(x2|x1)p(x1). (8.3) For a given choice of K, we can again represent this as a directed graph having K nodes, one for each conditional distribution on the right-hand side of (8.3), with each node having incoming links from all lower numbered nodes. We say that this graph is fully connected because there is a link between every pair of nodes. So far, we have worked with completely general joint distributions, so that the decompositions, and their representations as fully connected graphs, will be applica- ble to any choice of distribution. As we shall see shortly, it is the absence of links in the graph that conveys interesting information about the properties of the class of distributions that the graph represents. Consider the graph shown in Figure 8.2. This is not a fully connected graph because, for instance, there is no link from x1 to x2 or from x3 to x7. We shall now go from this graph to the corresponding representation of the joint probability distribution written in terms of the product of a set of conditional dis- tributions, one for each node in the graph. Each such conditional distribution will be conditioned only on the parents of the corresponding node in the graph. For in- stance, x5 will be conditioned on x1 and x3.

The corresponding decomposition of the joint distribution is given by (8.4). x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 is therefore given by p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x4|x1, x2, x3)p(x5|x1, x3)p(x6|x4)p(x7|x4, x5). (8.4) The reader should take a moment to study carefully the correspondence between (8.4) and Figure 8.2. We can now state in general terms the relationship between a given directed graph and the corresponding distribution over the variables. The joint distribution de\ufb01ned by a graph is given by the product, over all of the nodes of the graph, of a conditional distribution for each node conditioned on the variables corresponding to the parents of that node in the graph. Thus, for a graph with K nodes, the joint distribution is given by p(x) = K \u000e k=1 p(xk|pak) (8.5) where pak denotes the set of parents of xk, and x = {x1, . . . , xK}. This key equation expresses the factorization properties of the joint distribution for a directed graphical model. Although we have considered each node to correspond to a single variable, we can equally well associate sets of variables and vector-valued variables with the nodes of a graph. It is easy to show that the representation on the right- hand side of (8.5) is always correctly normalized provided the individual conditional distributions are normalized. Exercise 8.1 The directed graphs that we are considering are subject to an important restric- tion namely that there must be no directed cycles, in other words there are no closed paths within the graph such that we can move from node to node along links follow- ing the direction of the arrows and end up back at the starting node. Such graphs are also called directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. This is equivalent to the statement that Exercise 8.2 there exists an ordering of the nodes such that there are no links that go from any node to any lower numbered node. 8.1.1 Example: Polynomial regression As an illustration of the use of directed graphs to describe probability distri- butions, we consider the Bayesian polynomial regression model introduced in Sec-",

Focussing just on the random variables for the moment, we see that the joint distribution is given by the product of the prior p(w) and N conditional distributions p(tn|w) for n = 1, . . . , N so that p(t, w) = p(w) N \u000e n=1 p(tn|w). (8.6) This joint distribution can be represented by a graphical model shown in Figure 8.3. When we start to deal with more complex models later in the book, we shall \ufb01nd it inconvenient to have to write out multiple nodes of the form t1, . . . , tN explicitly as in Figure 8.3. We therefore introduce a graphical notation that allows such multiple nodes to be expressed more compactly, in which we draw a single representative node tn and then surround this with a box, called a plate, labelled with N indicating that there are N nodes of this kind. Re-writing the graph of Figure 8.3 in this way, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 8.4. We shall sometimes \ufb01nd it helpful to make the parameters of a model, as well as its stochastic variables, explicit. In this case, (8.6) becomes p(t, w|x, \u03b1, \u03c32) = p(w|\u03b1) N \u000e n=1 p(tn|w, xn, \u03c32). Correspondingly, we can make x and \u03b1 explicit in the graphical representation.

Note that the value of w is not observed, and so w is an example of a latent variable, also known as a hidden variable. Such variables play a crucial role in many probabilistic models and will form the focus of Chapters 9 and 12. Having observed the values {tn} we can, if desired, evaluate the posterior dis- tribution of the polynomial coef\ufb01cients w as discussed in Section 1.2.5.

The details of this calculation were discussed in Chapter 3. 8.1.2 Generative models There are many situations in which we wish to draw samples from a given prob- ability distribution. Although we shall devote the whole of Chapter 11 to a detailed discussion of sampling methods, it is instructive to outline here one technique, called ancestral sampling, which is particularly relevant to graphical models. Consider a joint distribution p(x1, . . . , xK) over K variables that factorizes according to (8.5) corresponding to a directed acyclic graph. We shall suppose that the variables have been ordered such that there are no links from any node to any lower numbered node, in other words each node has a higher number than any of its parents. Our goal is to draw a sample \u0001x1, . . . , \u0001xK from the joint distribution. To do this, we start with the lowest-numbered node and draw a sample from the distribution p(x1), which we call \u0001x1. We then work through each of the nodes in or- der, so that for node n we draw a sample from the conditional distribution p(xn|pan) in which the parent variables have been set to their sampled values. Note that at each stage, these parent values will always be available because they correspond to lower- numbered nodes that have already been sampled. Techniques for sampling from speci\ufb01c distributions will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Once we have sam- pled from the \ufb01nal variable xK, we will have achieved our objective of obtaining a sample from the joint distribution. To obtain a sample from some marginal distribu- tion corresponding to a subset of the variables, we simply take the sampled values for the required nodes and ignore the sampled values for the remaining nodes. For example, to draw a sample from the distribution p(x2, x4), we simply sample from the full joint distribution and then retain the values \u0001x2, \u0001x4 and discard the remaining values {\u0001xj\u0338=2,4}.",

GRAPHICAL MODELS Figure 8.8 A graphical model representing the process by which images of objects are created, in which the identity of an object (a discrete variable) and the position and orientation of that object (continuous variables) have independent prior probabilities. The image (a vector of pixel intensities) has a probability distribution that is dependent on the identity of the object as well as on its position and orientation. Image Object Orientation Position For practical applications of probabilistic models, it will typically be the higher- numbered variables corresponding to terminal nodes of the graph that represent the observations, with lower-numbered nodes corresponding to latent variables. The primary role of the latent variables is to allow a complicated distribution over the observed variables to be represented in terms of a model constructed from simpler (typically exponential family) conditional distributions. We can interpret such models as expressing the processes by which the observed data arose. For instance, consider an object recognition task in which each observed data point corresponds to an image (comprising a vector of pixel intensities) of one of the objects. In this case, the latent variables might have an interpretation as the position and orientation of the object. Given a particular observed image, our goal is to \ufb01nd the posterior distribution over objects, in which we integrate over all possible positions and orientations. We can represent this problem using a graphical model of the form show in Figure 8.8. The graphical model captures the causal process (Pearl, 1988) by which the ob- served data was generated. For this reason, such models are often called generative models. By contrast, the polynomial regression model described by Figure 8.5 is not generative because there is no probability distribution associated with the input variable x, and so it is not possible to generate synthetic data points from this model. We could make it generative by introducing a suitable prior distribution p(x), at the expense of a more complex model. The hidden variables in a probabilistic model need not, however, have any ex- plicit physical interpretation but may be introduced simply to allow a more complex joint distribution to be constructed from simpler components. In either case, the technique of ancestral sampling applied to a generative model mimics the creation of the observed data and would therefore give rise to \u2018fantasy\u2019 data whose probability distribution (if the model were a perfect representation of reality) would be the same as that of the observed data. In practice, producing synthetic observations from a generative model can prove informative in understanding the form of the probability distribution represented by that model. 8.1.3 Discrete variables We have discussed the importance of probability distributions that are members of the exponential family, and we have seen that this family includes many well- Section 2.4 known distributions as particular cases.

(a) x1 x2 (b) x1 x2 distributions, and the framework of graphical models is very useful in expressing the way in which these building blocks are linked together. Such models have particularly nice properties if we choose the relationship be- tween each parent-child pair in a directed graph to be conjugate, and we shall ex- plore several examples of this shortly. Two cases are particularly worthy of note, namely when the parent and child node each correspond to discrete variables and when they each correspond to Gaussian variables, because in these two cases the relationship can be extended hierarchically to construct arbitrarily complex directed acyclic graphs. We begin by examining the discrete case. The probability distribution p(x|\u00b5) for a single discrete variable x having K possible states (using the 1-of-K representation) is given by p(x|\u00b5) = K \u000e k=1 \u00b5xk k (8.9) and is governed by the parameters \u00b5 = (\u00b51, . . . , \u00b5K)T. Due to the constraint \u0005 k \u00b5k = 1, only K \u22121 values for \u00b5k need to be speci\ufb01ed in order to de\ufb01ne the distribution. Now suppose that we have two discrete variables, x1 and x2, each of which has K states, and we wish to model their joint distribution. We denote the probability of observing both x1k = 1 and x2l = 1 by the parameter \u00b5kl, where x1k denotes the kth component of x1, and similarly for x2l. The joint distribution can be written p(x1, x2|\u00b5) = K \u000e k=1 K \u000e l=1 \u00b5x1kx2l kl . Because the parameters \u00b5kl are subject to the constraint \u0005 k \u0005 l \u00b5kl = 1, this distri- bution is governed by K2 \u22121 parameters. It is easily seen that the total number of parameters that must be speci\ufb01ed for an arbitrary joint distribution over M variables is KM \u22121 and therefore grows exponentially with the number M of variables. Using the product rule, we can factor the joint distribution p(x1, x2) in the form p(x2|x1)p(x1), which corresponds to a two-node graph with a link going from the x1 node to the x2 node as shown in Figure 8.9(a). The marginal distribution p(x1) is governed by K \u22121 parameters, as before, Similarly, the conditional distribution p(x2|x1) requires the speci\ufb01cation of K \u22121 parameters for each of the K possible values of x1. The total number of parameters that must be speci\ufb01ed in the joint distribution is therefore (K \u22121) + K(K \u22121) = K2 \u22121 as before. Now suppose that the variables x1 and x2 were independent, corresponding to the graphical model shown in Figure 8.9(b). Each variable is then described by",

GRAPHICAL MODELS Figure 8.10 This chain of M discrete nodes, each having K states, requires the speci\ufb01cation of K \u22121 + (M \u22121)K(K \u22121) parameters, which grows linearly with the length M of the chain. In contrast, a fully con- nected graph of M nodes would have KM \u22121 param- eters, which grows exponentially with M. x1 x2 xM a separate multinomial distribution, and the total number of parameters would be 2(K \u22121). For a distribution over M independent discrete variables, each having K states, the total number of parameters would be M(K \u22121), which therefore grows linearly with the number of variables. From a graphical perspective, we have reduced the number of parameters by dropping links in the graph, at the expense of having a restricted class of distributions. More generally, if we have M discrete variables x1, . . . , xM, we can model the joint distribution using a directed graph with one variable corresponding to each node. The conditional distribution at each node is given by a set of nonnegative pa- rameters subject to the usual normalization constraint. If the graph is fully connected then we have a completely general distribution having KM \u22121 parameters, whereas if there are no links in the graph the joint distribution factorizes into the product of the marginals, and the total number of parameters is M(K \u22121). Graphs having in- termediate levels of connectivity allow for more general distributions than the fully factorized one while requiring fewer parameters than the general joint distribution. As an illustration, consider the chain of nodes shown in Figure 8.10. The marginal distribution p(x1) requires K \u22121 parameters, whereas each of the M \u22121 condi- tional distributions p(xi|xi\u22121), for i = 2, . . . , M, requires K(K \u22121) parameters. This gives a total parameter count of K \u22121+(M \u22121)K(K \u22121), which is quadratic in K and which grows linearly (rather than exponentially) with the length M of the chain. An alternative way to reduce the number of independent parameters in a model is by sharing parameters (also known as tying of parameters). For instance, in the chain example of Figure 8.10, we can arrange that all of the conditional distributions p(xi|xi\u22121), for i = 2, . . . , M, are governed by the same set of K(K\u22121) parameters. Together with the K\u22121 parameters governing the distribution of x1, this gives a total of K2 \u22121 parameters that must be speci\ufb01ed in order to de\ufb01ne the joint distribution. We can turn a graph over discrete variables into a Bayesian model by introduc- ing Dirichlet priors for the parameters. From a graphical point of view, each node then acquires an additional parent representing the Dirichlet distribution over the pa- rameters associated with the corresponding discrete node. This is illustrated for the chain model in Figure 8.11. The corresponding model in which we tie the parame- ters governing the conditional distributions p(xi|xi\u22121), for i = 2, . . . , M, is shown in Figure 8.12. Another way of controlling the exponential growth in the number of parameters in models of discrete variables is to use parameterized models for the conditional distributions instead of complete tables of conditional probability values. To illus- trate this idea, consider the graph in Figure 8.13 in which all of the nodes represent binary variables. Each of the parent variables xi is governed by a single parame-",

The conditional distribution p(y|x1, . . . , xM), however, would require 2M parameters representing the probability p(y = 1) for each of the 2M possible settings of the parent variables. Thus in general the number of parameters required to specify this conditional distribution will grow exponentially with M. We can ob- tain a more parsimonious form for the conditional distribution by using a logistic sigmoid function acting on a linear combination of the parent variables, giving Section 2.4 p(y = 1|x1, . . . , xM) = \u03c3 \u0016 w0 + M \u0002 i=1 wixi \u0017 = \u03c3(wTx) (8.10) where \u03c3(a) = (1+exp(\u2212a))\u22121 is the logistic sigmoid, x = (x0, x1, . . . , xM)T is an (M + 1)-dimensional vector of parent states augmented with an additional variable x0 whose value is clamped to 1, and w = (w0, w1, . . . , wM)T is a vector of M + 1 parameters. This is a more restricted form of conditional distribution than the general case but is now governed by a number of parameters that grows linearly with M. In this sense, it is analogous to the choice of a restrictive form of covariance matrix (for example, a diagonal matrix) in a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The motivation for the logistic sigmoid representation was discussed in Section 4.2.

GRAPHICAL MODELS 8.1.4 Linear-Gaussian models In the previous section, we saw how to construct joint probability distributions over a set of discrete variables by expressing the variables as nodes in a directed acyclic graph. Here we show how a multivariate Gaussian can be expressed as a directed graph corresponding to a linear-Gaussian model over the component vari- ables. This allows us to impose interesting structure on the distribution, with the general Gaussian and the diagonal covariance Gaussian representing opposite ex- tremes. Several widely used techniques are examples of linear-Gaussian models, such as probabilistic principal component analysis, factor analysis, and linear dy- namical systems (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999). We shall make extensive use of the results of this section in later chapters when we consider some of these techniques in detail. Consider an arbitrary directed acyclic graph over D variables in which node i represents a single continuous random variable xi having a Gaussian distribution. The mean of this distribution is taken to be a linear combination of the states of its parent nodes pai of node i p(xi|pai) = N \u239b \u239dxi \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \u0002 j\u2208pai wijxj + bi, vi \u239e \u23a0 (8.11) where wij and bi are parameters governing the mean, and vi is the variance of the conditional distribution for xi. The log of the joint distribution is then the log of the product of these conditionals over all nodes in the graph and hence takes the form ln p(x) = D \u0002 i=1 ln p(xi|pai) (8.12) = \u2212 D \u0002 i=1 1 2vi \u239b \u239dxi \u2212 \u0002 j\u2208pai wijxj \u2212bi \u239e \u23a0 2 + const (8.13) where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T and \u2018const\u2019 denotes terms independent of x. We see that this is a quadratic function of the components of x, and hence the joint distribution p(x) is a multivariate Gaussian. We can determine the mean and covariance of the joint distribution recursively as follows. Each variable xi has (conditional on the states of its parents) a Gaussian distribution of the form (8.11) and so xi = \u0002 j\u2208pai wijxj + bi + \u221avi\u03f5i (8.14) where \u03f5i is a zero mean, unit variance Gaussian random variable satisfying E[\u03f5i] = 0 and E[\u03f5i\u03f5j] = Iij, where Iij is the i, j element of the identity matrix. Taking the expectation of (8.14), we have E[xi] = \u0002 j\u2208pai wijE[xj] + bi. (8.15)",

Similarly, we can use (8.14) and (8.15) to obtain the i, j element of the covariance matrix for p(x) in the form of a recursion relation cov[xi, xj] = E [(xi \u2212E[xi])(xj \u2212E[xj])] = E \u23a1 \u23a3(xi \u2212E[xi]) \u23a7 \u23a8 \u23a9 \u0002 k\u2208paj wjk(xk \u2212E[xk]) + \u221avj\u03f5j \u23ab \u23ac \u23ad \u23a4 \u23a6 = \u0002 k\u2208paj wjkcov[xi, xk] + Iijvj (8.16) and so the covariance can similarly be evaluated recursively starting from the lowest numbered node. Let us consider two extreme cases. First of all, suppose that there are no links in the graph, which therefore comprises D isolated nodes. In this case, there are no parameters wij and so there are just D parameters bi and D parameters vi. From the recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean of p(x) is given by (b1, . . . , bD)T and the covariance matrix is diagonal of the form diag(v1, . . . , vD). The joint distribution has a total of 2D parameters and represents a set of D inde- pendent univariate Gaussian distributions. Now consider a fully connected graph in which each node has all lower num- bered nodes as parents. The matrix wij then has i \u22121 entries on the ith row and hence is a lower triangular matrix (with no entries on the leading diagonal). Then the total number of parameters wij is obtained by taking the number D2 of elements in a D \u00d7D matrix, subtracting D to account for the absence of elements on the lead- ing diagonal, and then dividing by 2 because the matrix has elements only below the diagonal, giving a total of D(D\u22121)/2. The total number of independent parameters {wij} and {vi} in the covariance matrix is therefore D(D + 1)/2 corresponding to a general symmetric covariance matrix. Section 2.3 Graphs having some intermediate level of complexity correspond to joint Gaus- sian distributions with partially constrained covariance matrices. Consider for ex- ample the graph shown in Figure 8.14, which has a link missing between variables x1 and x3. Using the recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean and covariance of the joint distribution are given by Exercise 8.7 \u00b5 = (b1, b2 + w21b1, b3 + w32b2 + w32w21b1)T (8.17) \u03a3 = \u0016 v1 w21v1 w32w21v1 w21v1 v2 + w2 21v1 w32(v2 + w2 21v1) w32w21v1 w32(v2 + w2 21v1) v3 + w2 32(v2 + w2 21v1) \u0017 .

    "text": "372 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS We can readily extend the linear-Gaussian graphical model to the case in which the nodes of the graph represent multivariate Gaussian variables. In this case, we can write the conditional distribution for node i in the form p(xi|pai) = N \u239b \u239dxi \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \u0002 j\u2208pai Wijxj + bi, \u03a3i \u239e \u23a0 (8.19) where now Wij is a matrix (which is nonsquare if xi and xj have different dimen- sionalities). Again it is easy to verify that the joint distribution over all variables is Gaussian. Note that we have already encountered a speci\ufb01c example of the linear-Gaussian relationship when we saw that the conjugate prior for the mean \u00b5 of a Gaussian Section 2.3.6 variable x is itself a Gaussian distribution over \u00b5. The joint distribution over x and \u00b5 is therefore Gaussian. This corresponds to a simple two-node graph in which the node representing \u00b5 is the parent of the node representing x. The mean of the distribution over \u00b5 is a parameter controlling a prior, and so it can be viewed as a hyperparameter. Because the value of this hyperparameter may itself be unknown, we can again treat it from a Bayesian perspective by introducing a prior over the hyperparameter, sometimes called a hyperprior, which is again given by a Gaussian distribution. This type of construction can be extended in principle to any level and is an illustration of a hierarchical Bayesian model, of which we shall encounter further examples in later chapters. 8.2. Conditional Independence An important concept for probability distributions over multiple variables is that of conditional independence (Dawid, 1980). Consider three variables a, b, and c, and suppose that the conditional distribution of a, given b and c, is such that it does not depend on the value of b, so that p(a|b, c) = p(a|c). (8.20) We say that a is conditionally independent of b given c. This can be expressed in a slightly different way if we consider the joint distribution of a and b conditioned on c, which we can write in the form p(a, b|c) = p(a|b, c)p(b|c) = p(a|c)p(b|c). (8.21) where we have used the product rule of probability together with (8.20). Thus we see that, conditioned on c, the joint distribution of a and b factorizes into the prod- uct of the marginal distribution of a and the marginal distribution of b (again both conditioned on c). This says that the variables a and b are statistically independent, given c. Note that our de\ufb01nition of conditional independence will require that (8.20),",

We shall sometimes use a shorthand notation for conditional independence (Dawid, 1979) in which a \u22a5\u22a5b | c (8.22) denotes that a is conditionally independent of b given c and is equivalent to (8.20). Conditional independence properties play an important role in using probabilis- tic models for pattern recognition by simplifying both the structure of a model and the computations needed to perform inference and learning under that model. We shall see examples of this shortly. If we are given an expression for the joint distribution over a set of variables in terms of a product of conditional distributions (i.e., the mathematical representation underlying a directed graph), then we could in principle test whether any poten- tial conditional independence property holds by repeated application of the sum and product rules of probability. In practice, such an approach would be very time con- suming. An important and elegant feature of graphical models is that conditional independence properties of the joint distribution can be read directly from the graph without having to perform any analytical manipulations. The general framework for achieving this is called d-separation, where the \u2018d\u2019 stands for \u2018directed\u2019 (Pearl, 1988). Here we shall motivate the concept of d-separation and give a general state- ment of the d-separation criterion. A formal proof can be found in Lauritzen (1996). 8.2.1 Three example graphs We begin our discussion of the conditional independence properties of directed graphs by considering three simple examples each involving graphs having just three nodes. Together, these will motivate and illustrate the key concepts of d-separation. The \ufb01rst of the three examples is shown in Figure 8.15, and the joint distribution corresponding to this graph is easily written down using the general result (8.5) to give p(a, b, c) = p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c). (8.23) If none of the variables are observed, then we can investigate whether a and b are independent by marginalizing both sides of (8.23) with respect to c to give p(a, b) = \u0002 c p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c).

Of course, it may hold for a particular distribution by virtue of the speci\ufb01c numerical values associated with the various conditional probabilities, but it does not follow in general from the structure of the graph. Now suppose we condition on the variable c, as represented by the graph of Figure 8.16. From (8.23), we can easily write down the conditional distribution of a and b, given c, in the form p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c) p(c) = p(a|c)p(b|c) and so we obtain the conditional independence property a \u22a5\u22a5b | c. We can provide a simple graphical interpretation of this result by considering the path from node a to node b via c. The node c is said to be tail-to-tail with re- spect to this path because the node is connected to the tails of the two arrows, and the presence of such a path connecting nodes a and b causes these nodes to be de- pendent. However, when we condition on node c, as in Figure 8.16, the conditioned node \u2018blocks\u2019 the path from a to b and causes a and b to become (conditionally) independent. We can similarly consider the graph shown in Figure 8.17. The joint distribution corresponding to this graph is again obtained from our general formula (8.5) to give p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c).

The conditional distri- bution of a and b is then given by p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c) p(c) = p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b) p(c) which in general does not factorize into the product p(a)p(b), and so a \u0338\u22a5\u22a5b | c. Thus our third example has the opposite behaviour from the \ufb01rst two. Graphically, we say that node c is head-to-head with respect to the path from a to b because it connects to the heads of the two arrows. When node c is unobserved, it \u2018blocks\u2019 the path, and the variables a and b are independent. However, conditioning on c \u2018unblocks\u2019 the path and renders a and b dependent. There is one more subtlety associated with this third example that we need to consider. First we introduce some more terminology. We say that node y is a de- scendant of node x if there is a path from x to y in which each step of the path follows the directions of the arrows. Then it can be shown that a head-to-head path will become unblocked if either the node, or any of its descendants, is observed. Exercise 8.10 In summary, a tail-to-tail node or a head-to-tail node leaves a path unblocked unless it is observed in which case it blocks the path. By contrast, a head-to-head node blocks a path if it is unobserved, but once the node, and/or at least one of its descendants, is observed the path becomes unblocked. It is worth spending a moment to understand further the unusual behaviour of the graph of Figure 8.20. Consider a particular instance of such a graph corresponding to a problem with three binary random variables relating to the fuel system on a car, as shown in Figure 8.21. The variables are called B, representing the state of a battery that is either charged (B = 1) or \ufb02at (B = 0), F representing the state of the fuel tank that is either full of fuel (F = 1) or empty (F = 0), and G, which is the state of an electric fuel gauge and which indicates either full (G = 1) or empty",

The battery is either charged or \ufb02at, and independently the fuel tank is either full or empty, with prior probabilities p(B = 1) = 0.9 p(F = 1) = 0.9. Given the state of the fuel tank and the battery, the fuel gauge reads full with proba- bilities given by p(G = 1|B = 1, F = 1) = 0.8 p(G = 1|B = 1, F = 0) = 0.2 p(G = 1|B = 0, F = 1) = 0.2 p(G = 1|B = 0, F = 0) = 0.1 so this is a rather unreliable fuel gauge! All remaining probabilities are determined by the requirement that probabilities sum to one, and so we have a complete speci\ufb01- cation of the probabilistic model.

Next suppose that we also check the state of the battery and \ufb01nd that it is \ufb02at, i.e., B = 0. We have now observed the states of both the fuel gauge and the battery, as shown by the right-hand graph in Figure 8.21. The posterior probability that the fuel tank is empty given the observations of both the fuel gauge and the battery state is then given by p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) = p(G = 0|B = 0, F = 0)p(F = 0) \u0005 F \u2208{0,1} p(G = 0|B = 0, F)p(F) \u22430.111 (8.33) where the prior probability p(B = 0) has cancelled between numerator and denom- inator. Thus the probability that the tank is empty has decreased (from 0.257 to 0.111) as a result of the observation of the state of the battery. This accords with our intuition that \ufb01nding out that the battery is \ufb02at explains away the observation that the fuel gauge reads empty. We see that the state of the fuel tank and that of the battery have indeed become dependent on each other as a result of observing the reading on the fuel gauge. In fact, this would also be the case if, instead of observing the fuel gauge directly, we observed the state of some descendant of G. Note that the probability p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) \u22430.111 is greater than the prior probability p(F = 0) = 0.1 because the observation that the fuel gauge reads zero still provides some evidence in favour of an empty fuel tank. 8.2.2 D-separation We now give a general statement of the d-separation property (Pearl, 1988) for directed graphs. Consider a general directed graph in which A, B, and C are arbi- trary nonintersecting sets of nodes (whose union may be smaller than the complete set of nodes in the graph). We wish to ascertain whether a particular conditional independence statement A \u22a5\u22a5B | C is implied by a given directed acyclic graph. To do so, we consider all possible paths from any node in A to any node in B. Any such path is said to be blocked if it includes a node such that either (a) the arrows on the path meet either head-to-tail or tail-to-tail at the node, and the node is in the set C, or (b) the arrows meet head-to-head at the node, and neither the node, nor any of its descendants, is in the set C. If all paths are blocked, then A is said to be d-separated from B by C, and the joint distribution over all of the variables in the graph will satisfy A \u22a5\u22a5B | C. The concept of d-separation is illustrated in Figure 8.22. In graph (a), the path from a to b is not blocked by node f because it is a tail-to-tail node for this path and is not observed, nor is it blocked by node e because, although the latter is a head-to-head node, it has a descendant c because is in the conditioning set. Thus the conditional independence statement a \u22a5\u22a5b | c does not follow from this graph. In graph (b), the path from a to b is blocked by node f because this is a tail-to-tail node that is observed, and so the conditional independence property a \u22a5\u22a5b | f will",

For the purposes of d-separation, parameters such as \u03b1 and \u03c32 in Figure 8.5, indicated by small \ufb01lled circles, behave in the same was as observed nodes. How- ever, there are no marginal distributions associated with such nodes. Consequently parameter nodes never themselves have parents and so all paths through these nodes will always be tail-to-tail and hence blocked. Consequently they play no role in d-separation. Another example of conditional independence and d-separation is provided by the concept of i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) data introduced in Sec- tion 1.2.4. Consider the problem of \ufb01nding the posterior distribution for the mean of a univariate Gaussian distribution. This can be represented by the directed graph Section 2.3 shown in Figure 8.23 in which the joint distribution is de\ufb01ned by a prior p(\u00b5) to- gether with a set of conditional distributions p(xn|\u00b5) for n = 1, . . . , N. In practice, we observe D = {x1, . . . , xN} and our goal is to infer \u00b5. Suppose, for a moment, that we condition on \u00b5 and consider the joint distribution of the observations. Using d-separation, we note that there is a unique path from any xi to any other xj\u0338=i and that this path is tail-to-tail with respect to the observed node \u00b5. Every such path is blocked and so the observations D = {x1, . . . , xN} are independent given \u00b5, so that p(D|\u00b5) = N \u000e n=1 p(xn|\u00b5).

(8.35) Here \u00b5 is a latent variable, because its value is not observed. Another example of a model representing i.i.d. data is the graph in Figure 8.7 corresponding to Bayesian polynomial regression. Here the stochastic nodes corre- spond to {tn}, w and \u0001t. We see that the node for w is tail-to-tail with respect to the path from\u0001t to any one of the nodes tn and so we have the following conditional independence property \u0001t \u22a5\u22a5tn | w. (8.36) Thus, conditioned on the polynomial coef\ufb01cients w, the predictive distribution for \u0001t is independent of the training data {t1, . . . , tN}. We can therefore \ufb01rst use the training data to determine the posterior distribution over the coef\ufb01cients w and then we can discard the training data and use the posterior distribution for w to make predictions of\u0001t for new input observations \u0001x. Section 3.3 A related graphical structure arises in an approach to classi\ufb01cation called the naive Bayes model, in which we use conditional independence assumptions to sim- plify the model structure. Suppose our observed variable consists of a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T, and we wish to assign observed values of x to one of K classes. Using the 1-of-K encoding scheme, we can represent these classes by a K- dimensional binary vector z. We can then de\ufb01ne a generative model by introducing a multinomial prior p(z|\u00b5) over the class labels, where the kth component \u00b5k of \u00b5 is the prior probability of class Ck, together with a conditional distribution p(x|z) for the observed vector x. The key assumption of the naive Bayes model is that, conditioned on the class z, the distributions of the input variables x1, . . . , xD are in- dependent. The graphical representation of this model is shown in Figure 8.24. We see that observation of z blocks the path between xi and xj for j \u0338= i (because such paths are tail-to-tail at the node z) and so xi and xj are conditionally independent given z. If, however, we marginalize out z (so that z is unobserved) the tail-to-tail path from xi to xj is no longer blocked. This tells us that in general the marginal density p(x) will not factorize with respect to the components of x. We encountered a simple application of the naive Bayes model in the context of fusing data from different sources for medical diagnosis in Section 1.5. If we are given a labelled training set, comprising inputs {x1, . . . , xN} together with their class labels, then we can \ufb01t the naive Bayes model to the training data",

The solution is obtained by \ufb01tting the model for each class separately using the correspondingly labelled data. As an example, suppose that the probability density within each class is chosen to be Gaussian. In this case, the naive Bayes assumption then implies that the covariance matrix for each Gaussian is diagonal, and the contours of constant density within each class will be axis-aligned ellipsoids. The marginal density, however, is given by a superposition of diagonal Gaussians (with weighting coef\ufb01cients given by the class priors) and so will no longer factorize with respect to its components. The naive Bayes assumption is helpful when the dimensionality D of the input space is high, making density estimation in the full D-dimensional space more chal- lenging. It is also useful if the input vector contains both discrete and continuous variables, since each can be represented separately using appropriate models (e.g., Bernoulli distributions for binary observations or Gaussians for real-valued vari- ables). The conditional independence assumption of this model is clearly a strong one that may lead to rather poor representations of the class-conditional densities. Nevertheless, even if this assumption is not precisely satis\ufb01ed, the model may still give good classi\ufb01cation performance in practice because the decision boundaries can be insensitive to some of the details in the class-conditional densities, as illustrated in Figure 1.27. We have seen that a particular directed graph represents a speci\ufb01c decomposition of a joint probability distribution into a product of conditional probabilities. The graph also expresses a set of conditional independence statements obtained through the d-separation criterion, and the d-separation theorem is really an expression of the equivalence of these two properties. In order to make this clear, it is helpful to think of a directed graph as a \ufb01lter. Suppose we consider a particular joint probability distribution p(x) over the variables x corresponding to the (nonobserved) nodes of the graph. The \ufb01lter will allow this distribution to pass through if, and only if, it can be expressed in terms of the factorization (8.5) implied by the graph. If we present to the \ufb01lter the set of all possible distributions p(x) over the set of variables x, then the subset of distributions that are passed by the \ufb01lter will be denoted DF, for directed factorization. This is illustrated in Figure 8.25. Alternatively, we can use the graph as a different kind of \ufb01lter by \ufb01rst listing all of the conditional independence properties obtained by applying the d-separation criterion to the graph, and then allowing a distribution to pass only if it satis\ufb01es all of these properties. If we present all possible distributions p(x) to this second kind of \ufb01lter, then the d-separation theorem tells us that the set of distributions that will be allowed through is precisely the set DF. It should be emphasized that the conditional independence properties obtained from d-separation apply to any probabilistic model described by that particular di- rected graph. This will be true, for instance, whether the variables are discrete or continuous or a combination of these. Again, we see that a particular graph is de- scribing a whole family of probability distributions. At one extreme we have a fully connected graph that exhibits no conditional in- dependence properties at all, and which can represent any possible joint probability distribution over the given variables.

The set of all possible probability distributions p(x) that pass through the \ufb01lter is denoted DF. We can alternatively use the graph to \ufb01lter distributions according to whether they respect all of the conditional independencies implied by the d-separation properties of the graph. The d-separation theorem says that it is the same set of distributions DF that will be allowed through this second kind of \ufb01lter. tions p(x). At the other extreme, we have the fully disconnected graph, i.e., one having no links at all. This corresponds to joint distributions which factorize into the product of the marginal distributions over the variables comprising the nodes of the graph. Note that for any given graph, the set of distributions DF will include any dis- tributions that have additional independence properties beyond those described by the graph. For instance, a fully factorized distribution will always be passed through the \ufb01lter implied by any graph over the corresponding set of variables. We end our discussion of conditional independence properties by exploring the concept of a Markov blanket or Markov boundary. Consider a joint distribution p(x1, . . . , xD) represented by a directed graph having D nodes, and consider the conditional distribution of a particular node with variables xi conditioned on all of the remaining variables xj\u0338=i. Using the factorization property (8.5), we can express this conditional distribution in the form p(xi|x{j\u0338=i}) = p(x1, . . . , xD) \u0006 p(x1, . . . , xD) dxi = \u000e k p(xk|pak) \u0006 \u000e k p(xk|pak) dxi in which the integral is replaced by a summation in the case of discrete variables. We now observe that any factor p(xk|pak) that does not have any functional dependence on xi can be taken outside the integral over xi, and will therefore cancel between numerator and denominator. The only factors that remain will be the conditional distribution p(xi|pai) for node xi itself, together with the conditional distributions for any nodes xk such that node xi is in the conditioning set of p(xk|pak), in other words for which xi is a parent of xk. The conditional p(xi|pai) will depend on the parents of node xi, whereas the conditionals p(xk|pak) will depend on the children",

The set of nodes comprising the parents, the children and the co-parents is called the Markov blanket and is illustrated in Figure 8.26. We can think of the Markov blanket of a node xi as being the minimal set of nodes that isolates xi from the rest of the graph. Note that it is not suf\ufb01cient to include only the parents and children of node xi because the phenomenon of explaining away means that observations of the child nodes will not block paths to the co-parents. We must therefore observe the co-parent nodes also. 8.3. Markov Random Fields We have seen that directed graphical models specify a factorization of the joint dis- tribution over a set of variables into a product of local conditional distributions. They also de\ufb01ne a set of conditional independence properties that must be satis\ufb01ed by any distribution that factorizes according to the graph. We turn now to the second ma- jor class of graphical models that are described by undirected graphs and that again specify both a factorization and a set of conditional independence relations. A Markov random \ufb01eld, also known as a Markov network or an undirected graphical model (Kindermann and Snell, 1980), has a set of nodes each of which corresponds to a variable or group of variables, as well as a set of links each of which connects a pair of nodes. The links are undirected, that is they do not carry arrows. In the case of undirected graphs, it is convenient to begin with a discussion of conditional independence properties. 8.3.1 Conditional independence properties In the case of directed graphs, we saw that it was possible to test whether a par- Section 8.2 ticular conditional independence property holds by applying a graphical test called d-separation. This involved testing whether or not the paths connecting two sets of nodes were \u2018blocked\u2019. The de\ufb01nition of blocked, however, was somewhat subtle due to the presence of paths having head-to-head nodes.

A C B directionality from the links of the graph, the asymmetry between parent and child nodes is removed, and so the subtleties associated with head-to-head nodes no longer arise. Suppose that in an undirected graph we identify three sets of nodes, denoted A, B, and C, and that we consider the conditional independence property A \u22a5\u22a5B | C. (8.37) To test whether this property is satis\ufb01ed by a probability distribution de\ufb01ned by a graph we consider all possible paths that connect nodes in set A to nodes in set B. If all such paths pass through one or more nodes in set C, then all such paths are \u2018blocked\u2019 and so the conditional independence property holds. However, if there is at least one such path that is not blocked, then the property does not necessarily hold, or more precisely there will exist at least some distributions corresponding to the graph that do not satisfy this conditional independence relation. This is illustrated with an example in Figure 8.27. Note that this is exactly the same as the d-separation crite- rion except that there is no \u2018explaining away\u2019 phenomenon. Testing for conditional independence in undirected graphs is therefore simpler than in directed graphs. An alternative way to view the conditional independence test is to imagine re- moving all nodes in set C from the graph together with any links that connect to those nodes. We then ask if there exists a path that connects any node in A to any node in B. If there are no such paths, then the conditional independence property must hold. The Markov blanket for an undirected graph takes a particularly simple form, because a node will be conditionally independent of all other nodes conditioned only on the neighbouring nodes, as illustrated in Figure 8.28. 8.3.2 Factorization properties We now seek a factorization rule for undirected graphs that will correspond to the above conditional independence test. Again, this will involve expressing the joint distribution p(x) as a product of functions de\ufb01ned over sets of variables that are local to the graph.

It has the property that the conditional distribution of xi, conditioned on all the remaining variables in the graph, is dependent only on the variables in the Markov blanket. If we consider two nodes xi and xj that are not connected by a link, then these variables must be conditionally independent given all other nodes in the graph. This follows from the fact that there is no direct path between the two nodes, and all other paths pass through nodes that are observed, and hence those paths are blocked. This conditional independence property can be expressed as p(xi, xj|x\\{i,j}) = p(xi|x\\{i,j})p(xj|x\\{i,j}) (8.38) where x\\{i,j} denotes the set x of all variables with xi and xj removed. The factor- ization of the joint distribution must therefore be such that xi and xj do not appear in the same factor in order for the conditional independence property to hold for all possible distributions belonging to the graph. This leads us to consider a graphical concept called a clique, which is de\ufb01ned as a subset of the nodes in a graph such that there exists a link between all pairs of nodes in the subset. In other words, the set of nodes in a clique is fully connected. Furthermore, a maximal clique is a clique such that it is not possible to include any other nodes from the graph in the set without it ceasing to be a clique. These concepts are illustrated by the undirected graph over four variables shown in Figure 8.29. This graph has \ufb01ve cliques of two nodes given by {x1, x2}, {x2, x3}, {x3, x4}, {x4, x2}, and {x1, x3}, as well as two maximal cliques given by {x1, x2, x3} and {x2, x3, x4}. The set {x1, x2, x3, x4} is not a clique because of the missing link from x1 to x4. We can therefore de\ufb01ne the factors in the decomposition of the joint distribution to be functions of the variables in the cliques. In fact, we can consider functions of the maximal cliques, without loss of generality, because other cliques must be subsets of maximal cliques. Thus, if {x1, x2, x3} is a maximal clique and we de\ufb01ne an arbitrary function over this clique, then including another factor de\ufb01ned over a subset of these variables would be redundant.

(8.39) Here the quantity Z, sometimes called the partition function, is a normalization con- stant and is given by Z = \u0002 x \u000e C \u03c8C(xC) (8.40) which ensures that the distribution p(x) given by (8.39) is correctly normalized. By considering only potential functions which satisfy \u03c8C(xC) \u2a7e0 we ensure that p(x) \u2a7e0. In (8.40) we have assumed that x comprises discrete variables, but the framework is equally applicable to continuous variables, or a combination of the two, in which the summation is replaced by the appropriate combination of summation and integration. Note that we do not restrict the choice of potential functions to those that have a speci\ufb01c probabilistic interpretation as marginal or conditional distributions. This is in contrast to directed graphs in which each factor represents the conditional distribu- tion of the corresponding variable, conditioned on the state of its parents. However, in special cases, for instance where the undirected graph is constructed by starting with a directed graph, the potential functions may indeed have such an interpretation, as we shall see shortly. One consequence of the generality of the potential functions \u03c8C(xC) is that their product will in general not be correctly normalized. We therefore have to in- troduce an explicit normalization factor given by (8.40). Recall that for directed graphs, the joint distribution was automatically normalized as a consequence of the normalization of each of the conditional distributions in the factorization. The presence of this normalization constant is one of the major limitations of undirected graphs. If we have a model with M discrete nodes each having K states, then the evaluation of the normalization term involves summing over KM states and so (in the worst case) is exponential in the size of the model. The partition function is needed for parameter learning because it will be a function of any parameters that govern the potential functions \u03c8C(xC). However, for evaluation of local conditional distributions, the partition function is not needed because a conditional is the ratio of two marginals, and the partition function cancels between numerator and denom- inator when evaluating this ratio. Similarly, for evaluating local marginal probabil- ities we can work with the unnormalized joint distribution and then normalize the marginals explicitly at the end. Provided the marginals only involves a small number of variables, the evaluation of their normalization coef\ufb01cient will be feasible. So far, we have discussed the notion of conditional independence based on sim- ple graph separation and we have proposed a factorization of the joint distribution that is intended to correspond to this conditional independence structure. However, we have not made any formal connection between conditional independence and factorization for undirected graphs. To do so we need to restrict attention to poten- tial functions \u03c8C(xC) that are strictly positive (i.e., never zero or negative for any",

To do this we again return to the concept of a graphical model as a \ufb01lter, corre- sponding to Figure 8.25. Consider the set of all possible distributions de\ufb01ned over a \ufb01xed set of variables corresponding to the nodes of a particular undirected graph. We can de\ufb01ne UI to be the set of such distributions that are consistent with the set of conditional independence statements that can be read from the graph using graph separation. Similarly, we can de\ufb01ne UF to be the set of such distributions that can be expressed as a factorization of the form (8.39) with respect to the maximal cliques of the graph. The Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Clifford, 1990) states that the sets UI and UF are identical. Because we are restricted to potential functions which are strictly positive it is convenient to express them as exponentials, so that \u03c8C(xC) = exp {\u2212E(xC)} (8.41) where E(xC) is called an energy function, and the exponential representation is called the Boltzmann distribution. The joint distribution is de\ufb01ned as the product of potentials, and so the total energy is obtained by adding the energies of each of the maximal cliques. In contrast to the factors in the joint distribution for a directed graph, the po- tentials in an undirected graph do not have a speci\ufb01c probabilistic interpretation. Although this gives greater \ufb02exibility in choosing the potential functions, because there is no normalization constraint, it does raise the question of how to motivate a choice of potential function for a particular application. This can be done by view- ing the potential function as expressing which con\ufb01gurations of the local variables are preferred to others. Global con\ufb01gurations that have a relatively high probability are those that \ufb01nd a good balance in satisfying the (possibly con\ufb02icting) in\ufb02uences of the clique potentials. We turn now to a speci\ufb01c example to illustrate the use of undirected graphs. 8.3.3 Illustration: Image de-noising We can illustrate the application of undirected graphs using an example of noise removal from a binary image (Besag, 1974; Geman and Geman, 1984; Besag, 1986). Although a very simple example, this is typical of more sophisticated applications. Let the observed noisy image be described by an array of binary pixel values yi \u2208 {\u22121, +1}, where the index i = 1, . . . , D runs over all pixels. We shall suppose that the image is obtained by taking an unknown noise-free image, described by binary pixel values xi \u2208{\u22121, +1} and randomly \ufb02ipping the sign of pixels with some small probability. An example binary image, together with a noise corrupted image obtained by \ufb02ipping the sign of the pixels with probability 10%, is shown in Figure 8.30. Given the noisy image, our goal is to recover the original noise-free image. Because the noise level is small, we know that there will be a strong correlation between xi and yi. We also know that neighbouring pixels xi and xj in an image are strongly correlated. This prior knowledge can be captured using the Markov",

(8.43) We now \ufb01x the elements of y to the observed values given by the pixels of the noisy image, which implicitly de\ufb01nes a conditional distribution p(x|y) over noise- free images. This is an example of the Ising model, which has been widely studied in statistical physics. For the purposes of image restoration, we wish to \ufb01nd an image x having a high probability (ideally the maximum probability). To do this we shall use a simple iterative technique called iterated conditional modes, or ICM (Kittler and F\u00a8oglein, 1984), which is simply an application of coordinate-wise gradient ascent. The idea is \ufb01rst to initialize the variables {xi}, which we do by simply setting xi = yi for all i. Then we take one node xj at a time and we evaluate the total energy for the two possible states xj = +1 and xj = \u22121, keeping all other node variables \ufb01xed, and set xj to whichever state has the lower energy. This will either leave the probability unchanged, if xj is unchanged, or will increase it. Because only one variable is changed, this is a simple local computation that can be performed Exercise 8.13 ef\ufb01ciently. We then repeat the update for another site, and so on, until some suitable stopping criterion is satis\ufb01ed. The nodes may be updated in a systematic way, for instance by repeatedly raster scanning through the image, or by choosing nodes at random. If we have a sequence of updates in which every site is visited at least once, and in which no changes to the variables are made, then by de\ufb01nition the algorithm",

Starting with the observed noisy image as the initial con\ufb01guration, we run ICM until convergence, leading to the de-noised image shown in the lower left panel of Figure 8.30. Note that if we set \u03b2 = 0, which effectively removes the links between neighbouring pixels, then the global most probable solution is given by xi = yi for all i, corresponding to the observed noisy image. Exercise 8.14 Later we shall discuss a more effective algorithm for \ufb01nding high probability so- lutions called the max-product algorithm, which typically leads to better solutions, Section 8.4 although this is still not guaranteed to \ufb01nd the global maximum of the posterior dis- tribution. However, for certain classes of model, including the one given by (8.42), there exist ef\ufb01cient algorithms based on graph cuts that are guaranteed to \ufb01nd the global maximum (Greig et al., 1989; Boykov et al., 2001; Kolmogorov and Zabih, 2004). The lower right panel of Figure 8.30 shows the result of applying a graph-cut algorithm to the de-noising problem. 8.3.4 Relation to directed graphs We have introduced two graphical frameworks for representing probability dis- tributions, corresponding to directed and undirected graphs, and it is instructive to discuss the relation between these. Consider \ufb01rst the problem of taking a model that is speci\ufb01ed using a directed graph and trying to convert it to an undirected graph. In some cases this is straightforward, as in the simple example in Figure 8.32. Here the joint distribution for the directed graph is given as a product of conditionals in the form p(x) = p(x1)p(x2|x1)p(x3|x2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p(xN|xN\u22121). (8.44) Now let us convert this to an undirected graph representation, as shown in Fig- ure 8.32. In the undirected graph, the maximal cliques are simply the pairs of neigh- bouring nodes, and so from (8.39) we wish to write the joint distribution in the form p(x) = 1 Z \u03c81,2(x1, x2)\u03c82,3(x2, x3) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c8N\u22121,N(xN\u22121, xN).

Note that in this case, the partition function Z = 1. Let us consider how to generalize this construction, so that we can convert any distribution speci\ufb01ed by a factorization over a directed graph into one speci\ufb01ed by a factorization over an undirected graph. This can be achieved if the clique potentials of the undirected graph are given by the conditional distributions of the directed graph. In order for this to be valid, we must ensure that the set of variables that appears in each of the conditional distributions is a member of at least one clique of the undirected graph. For nodes on the directed graph having just one parent, this is achieved simply by replacing the directed link with an undirected link. However, for nodes in the directed graph having more than one parent, this is not suf\ufb01cient. These are nodes that have \u2018head-to-head\u2019 paths encountered in our discussion of conditional independence. Consider a simple directed graph over 4 nodes shown in Figure 8.33. The joint distribution for the directed graph takes the form p(x) = p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x4|x1, x2, x3). (8.46) We see that the factor p(x4|x1, x2, x3) involves the four variables x1, x2, x3, and x4, and so these must all belong to a single clique if this conditional distribution is to be absorbed into a clique potential. To ensure this, we add extra links between all pairs of parents of the node x4. Anachronistically, this process of \u2018marrying the parents\u2019 has become known as moralization, and the resulting undirected graph, after dropping the arrows, is called the moral graph. It is important to observe that the moral graph in this example is fully connected and so exhibits no conditional independence properties, in contrast to the original directed graph. Thus in general to convert a directed graph into an undirected graph, we \ufb01rst add additional undirected links between all pairs of parents for each node in the graph and",

We then take each conditional distribution factor in the original directed graph and multiply it into one of the clique potentials. There will always exist at least one maximal clique that contains all of the variables in the factor as a result of the moralization step. Note that in all cases the partition function is given by Z = 1. The process of converting a directed graph into an undirected graph plays an important role in exact inference techniques such as the junction tree algorithm. Section 8.4 Converting from an undirected to a directed representation is much less common and in general presents problems due to the normalization constraints. We saw that in going from a directed to an undirected representation we had to discard some conditional independence properties from the graph. Of course, we could always trivially convert any distribution over a directed graph into one over an undirected graph by simply using a fully connected undirected graph. This would, however, discard all conditional independence properties and so would be vacuous. The process of moralization adds the fewest extra links and so retains the maximum number of independence properties. We have seen that the procedure for determining the conditional independence properties is different between directed and undirected graphs. It turns out that the two types of graph can express different conditional independence properties, and it is worth exploring this issue in more detail. To do so, we return to the view of a speci\ufb01c (directed or undirected) graph as a \ufb01lter, so that the set of all possible Section 8.2 distributions over the given variables could be reduced to a subset that respects the conditional independencies implied by the graph. A graph is said to be a D map (for \u2018dependency map\u2019) of a distribution if every conditional independence statement satis\ufb01ed by the distribution is re\ufb02ected in the graph. Thus a completely disconnected graph (no links) will be a trivial D map for any distribution. Alternatively, we can consider a speci\ufb01c distribution and ask which graphs have the appropriate conditional independence properties. If every conditional indepen- dence statement implied by a graph is satis\ufb01ed by a speci\ufb01c distribution, then the graph is said to be an I map (for \u2018independence map\u2019) of that distribution. Clearly a fully connected graph will be a trivial I map for any distribution. If it is the case that every conditional independence property of the distribution is re\ufb02ected in the graph, and vice versa, then the graph is said to be a perfect map for Figure 8.34 Venn diagram illustrating the set of all distributions P over a given set of variables, together with the set of distributions D that can be represented as a perfect map using a directed graph, and the set U that can be represented as a perfect map using an undirected graph.

This set is distinct from the set of distributions such that for each distribution there exists an undirected graph that is a perfect map. In addition there are distributions for which neither directed nor undirected graphs offer a perfect map. This is illustrated as a Venn diagram in Figure 8.34. Figure 8.35 shows an example of a directed graph that is a perfect map for a distribution satisfying the conditional independence properties A \u22a5\u22a5B | \u2205and A \u0338\u22a5\u22a5B | C.

There is no directed graph over four variables that implies the same set of conditional independence properties. The graphical framework can be extended in a consistent way to graphs that include both directed and undirected links. These are called chain graphs (Lauritzen and Wermuth, 1989; Frydenberg, 1990), and contain the directed and undirected graphs considered so far as special cases. Although such graphs can represent a broader class of distributions than either directed or undirected alone, there remain distributions for which even a chain graph cannot provide a perfect map.

Speci\ufb01cally, we shall see that many algorithms can be expressed in terms of the propagation of local messages around the graph. In this section, we shall focus primarily on techniques for exact inference, and in Chapter 10 we shall consider a number of approximate inference algorithms. To start with, let us consider the graphical interpretation of Bayes\u2019 theorem. Suppose we decompose the joint distribution p(x, y) over two variables x and y into a product of factors in the form p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x). This can be represented by the directed graph shown in Figure 8.37(a). Now suppose we observe the value of y, as indicated by the shaded node in Figure 8.37(b). We can view the marginal distribution p(x) as a prior over the latent variable x, and our goal is to infer the corresponding posterior distribution over x. Using the sum and product rules of probability we can evaluate p(y) = \u0002 x\u2032 p(y|x\u2032)p(x\u2032) (8.47) which can then be used in Bayes\u2019 theorem to calculate p(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x) p(y) . (8.48) Thus the joint distribution is now expressed in terms of p(y) and p(x|y). From a graphical perspective, the joint distribution p(x, y) is now represented by the graph shown in Figure 8.37(c), in which the direction of the arrow is reversed. This is the simplest example of an inference problem for a graphical model. 8.4.1 Inference on a chain Now consider a more complex problem involving the chain of nodes of the form shown in Figure 8.32. This example will lay the foundation for a discussion of exact inference in more general graphs later in this section. Speci\ufb01cally, we shall consider the undirected graph in Figure 8.32(b). We have already seen that the directed chain can be transformed into an equivalent undirected chain. Because the directed graph does not have any nodes with more than one parent, this does not require the addition of any extra links, and the directed and undirected versions of this graph express exactly the same set of conditional inde- pendence statements.",

(8.49) We shall consider the speci\ufb01c case in which the N nodes represent discrete vari- ables each having K states, in which case each potential function \u03c8n\u22121,n(xn\u22121, xn) comprises an K \u00d7 K table, and so the joint distribution has (N \u22121)K2 parameters. Let us consider the inference problem of \ufb01nding the marginal distribution p(xn) for a speci\ufb01c node xn that is part way along the chain. Note that, for the moment, there are no observed nodes. By de\ufb01nition, the required marginal is obtained by summing the joint distribution over all variables except xn, so that p(xn) = \u0002 x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0002 xn\u22121 \u0002 xn+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0002 xN p(x). (8.50) In a naive implementation, we would \ufb01rst evaluate the joint distribution and then perform the summations explicitly. The joint distribution can be represented as a set of numbers, one for each possible value for x. Because there are N variables each with K states, there are KN values for x and so evaluation and storage of the joint distribution, as well as marginalization to obtain p(xn), all involve storage and computation that scale exponentially with the length N of the chain. We can, however, obtain a much more ef\ufb01cient algorithm by exploiting the con- ditional independence properties of the graphical model. If we substitute the factor- ized expression (8.49) for the joint distribution into (8.50), then we can rearrange the order of the summations and the multiplications to allow the required marginal to be evaluated much more ef\ufb01ciently. Consider for instance the summation over xN. The potential \u03c8N\u22121,N(xN\u22121, xN) is the only one that depends on xN, and so we can perform the summation \u0002 xN \u03c8N\u22121,N(xN\u22121, xN) (8.51) \ufb01rst to give a function of xN\u22121. We can then use this to perform the summation over xN\u22121, which will involve only this new function together with the potential \u03c8N\u22122,N\u22121(xN\u22122, xN\u22121), because this is the only other place that xN\u22121 appears. Similarly, the summation over x1 involves only the potential \u03c81,2(x1, x2) and so can be performed separately to give a function of x2, and so on. Because each summation effectively removes a variable from the distribution, this can be viewed as the removal of a node from the graph. If we group the potentials and summations together in this way, we can express",

(8.52) The reader is encouraged to study this re-ordering carefully as the underlying idea forms the basis for the later discussion of the general sum-product algorithm. Here the key concept that we are exploiting is that multiplication is distributive over addi- tion, so that ab + ac = a(b + c) (8.53) in which the left-hand side involves three arithmetic operations whereas the right- hand side reduces this to two operations. Let us work out the computational cost of evaluating the required marginal using this re-ordered expression. We have to perform N \u22121 summations each of which is over K states and each of which involves a function of two variables. For instance, the summation over x1 involves only the function \u03c81,2(x1, x2), which is a table of K \u00d7 K numbers. We have to sum this table over x1 for each value of x2 and so this has O(K2) cost. The resulting vector of K numbers is multiplied by the matrix of numbers \u03c82,3(x2, x3) and so is again O(K2). Because there are N \u22121 summations and multiplications of this kind, the total cost of evaluating the marginal p(xn) is O(NK2). This is linear in the length of the chain, in contrast to the exponential cost of a naive approach. We have therefore been able to exploit the many conditional independence properties of this simple graph in order to obtain an ef\ufb01cient calcula- tion. If the graph had been fully connected, there would have been no conditional independence properties, and we would have been forced to work directly with the full joint distribution. We now give a powerful interpretation of this calculation in terms of the passing of local messages around on the graph. From (8.52) we see that the expression for the marginal p(xn) decomposes into the product of two factors times the normalization constant p(xn) = 1 Z \u00b5\u03b1(xn)\u00b5\u03b2(xn). (8.54) We shall interpret \u00b5\u03b1(xn) as a message passed forwards along the chain from node xn\u22121 to node xn. Similarly, \u00b5\u03b2(xn) can be viewed as a message passed backwards",

Note carefully the structure of the message passing equation. The outgoing message \u00b5\u03b1(xn) in (8.55) is obtained by multiplying the incoming message \u00b5\u03b1(xn\u22121) by the local potential involving the node variable and the outgoing variable and then summing over the node variable. Similarly, the message \u00b5\u03b2(xn) can be evaluated recursively by starting with node xN and using \u00b5\u03b2(xn) = \u0002 xn+1 \u03c8n+1,n(xn+1, xn) \u23a1 \u23a3\u0002 xn+2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u23a4 \u23a6 = \u0002 xn+1 \u03c8n+1,n(xn+1, xn)\u00b5\u03b2(xn+1). (8.57) This recursive message passing is illustrated in Figure 8.38. The normalization con- stant Z is easily evaluated by summing the right-hand side of (8.54) over all states of xn, an operation that requires only O(K) computation. Graphs of the form shown in Figure 8.38 are called Markov chains, and the corresponding message passing equations represent an example of the Chapman- Kolmogorov equations for Markov processes (Papoulis, 1984).",

Simply applying the above procedure separately for each node will have computational cost that is O(N 2M 2). However, such an approach would be very wasteful of computation. For instance, to \ufb01nd p(x1) we need to prop- agate a message \u00b5\u03b2(\u00b7) from node xN back to node x2. Similarly, to evaluate p(x2) we need to propagate a messages \u00b5\u03b2(\u00b7) from node xN back to node x3. This will involve much duplicated computation because most of the messages will be identical in the two cases. Suppose instead we \ufb01rst launch a message \u00b5\u03b2(xN\u22121) starting from node xN and propagate corresponding messages all the way back to node x1, and suppose we similarly launch a message \u00b5\u03b1(x2) starting from node x1 and propagate the corre- sponding messages all the way forward to node xN. Provided we store all of the intermediate messages along the way, then any node can evaluate its marginal sim- ply by applying (8.54). The computational cost is only twice that for \ufb01nding the marginal of a single node, rather than N times as much. Observe that a message has passed once in each direction across each link in the graph. Note also that the normalization constant Z need be evaluated only once, using any convenient node. If some of the nodes in the graph are observed, then the corresponding variables are simply clamped to their observed values and there is no summation. To see this, note that the effect of clamping a variable xn to an observed value \u0001xn can be expressed by multiplying the joint distribution by (one or more copies of) an additional function I(xn, \u0001xn), which takes the value 1 when xn = \u0001xn and the value 0 otherwise. One such function can then be absorbed into each of the potentials that contain xn. Summations over xn then contain only one term in which xn = \u0001xn. Now suppose we wish to calculate the joint distribution p(xn\u22121, xn) for two neighbouring nodes on the chain. This is similar to the evaluation of the marginal for a single node, except that there are now two variables that are not summed out. A few moments thought will show that the required joint distribution can be written Exercise 8.15 in the form p(xn\u22121, xn) = 1 Z \u00b5\u03b1(xn\u22121)\u03c8n\u22121,n(xn\u22121, xn)\u00b5\u03b2(xn). (8.58) Thus we can obtain the joint distributions over all of the sets of variables in each of the potentials directly once we have completed the message passing required to obtain the marginals. This is a useful result because in practice we may wish to use parametric forms for the clique potentials, or equivalently for the conditional distributions if we started from a directed graph. In order to learn the parameters of these potentials in situa- tions where not all of the variables are observed, we can employ the EM algorithm, Chapter 9 and it turns out that the local joint distributions of the cliques, conditioned on any observed data, is precisely what is needed in the E step.

In particular, we shall shortly generalize the message passing formalism derived above for chains to give the sum-product algorithm, which provides an ef\ufb01cient framework for exact inference in tree-structured graphs. In the case of an undirected graph, a tree is de\ufb01ned as a graph in which there is one, and only one, path between any pair of nodes. Such graphs therefore do not have loops. In the case of directed graphs, a tree is de\ufb01ned such that there is a single node, called the root, which has no parents, and all other nodes have one parent. If we convert a directed tree into an undirected graph, we see that the moralization step will not add any links as all nodes have at most one parent, and as a consequence the corresponding moralized graph will be an undirected tree. Examples of undirected and directed trees are shown in Figure 8.39(a) and 8.39(b). Note that a distribution represented as a directed tree can easily be converted into one represented by an undirected tree, and vice versa. Exercise 8.18 If there are nodes in a directed graph that have more than one parent, but there is still only one path (ignoring the direction of the arrows) between any two nodes, then the graph is a called a polytree, as illustrated in Figure 8.39(c). Such a graph will have more than one node with the property of having no parents, and furthermore, the corresponding moralized undirected graph will have loops. 8.4.3 Factor graphs The sum-product algorithm that we derive in the next section is applicable to undirected and directed trees and to polytrees. It can be cast in a particularly simple and general form if we \ufb01rst introduce a new graphical construction called a factor graph (Frey, 1998; Kschischnang et al., 2001). Both directed and undirected graphs allow a global function of several vari- ables to be expressed as a product of factors over subsets of those variables. Factor graphs make this decomposition explicit by introducing additional nodes for the fac- tors themselves in addition to the nodes representing the variables. They also allow us to be more explicit about the details of the factorization, as we shall see. Let us write the joint distribution over a set of variables in the form of a product of factors p(x) = \u000e s fs(xs) (8.59) where xs denotes a subset of the variables. For convenience, we shall denote the",

Each factor fs is a function of a corresponding set of variables xs. Directed graphs, whose factorization is de\ufb01ned by (8.5), represent special cases of (8.59) in which the factors fs(xs) are local conditional distributions. Similarly, undirected graphs, given by (8.39), are a special case in which the factors are po- tential functions over the maximal cliques (the normalizing coef\ufb01cient 1/Z can be viewed as a factor de\ufb01ned over the empty set of variables). In a factor graph, there is a node (depicted as usual by a circle) for every variable in the distribution, as was the case for directed and undirected graphs. There are also additional nodes (depicted by small squares) for each factor fs(xs) in the joint dis- tribution. Finally, there are undirected links connecting each factor node to all of the variables nodes on which that factor depends. Consider, for example, a distribution that is expressed in terms of the factorization p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x1, x2)fc(x2, x3)fd(x3). (8.60) This can be expressed by the factor graph shown in Figure 8.40. Note that there are two factors fa(x1, x2) and fb(x1, x2) that are de\ufb01ned over the same set of variables. In an undirected graph, the product of two such factors would simply be lumped together into the same clique potential. Similarly, fc(x2, x3) and fd(x3) could be combined into a single potential over x2 and x3. The factor graph, however, keeps such factors explicit and so is able to convey more detailed information about the underlying factorization. x1 x2 x3 (a) x1 x2 x3 f (b) x1 x2 x3 fa fb (c) Figure 8.41 (a) An undirected graph with a single clique potential \u03c8(x1, x2, x3).

Factor graphs are said to be bipartite because they consist of two distinct kinds of nodes, and all links go between nodes of opposite type. In general, factor graphs can therefore always be drawn as two rows of nodes (variable nodes at the top and factor nodes at the bottom) with links between the rows, as shown in the example in Figure 8.40. In some situations, however, other ways of laying out the graph may be more intuitive, for example when the factor graph is derived from a directed or undirected graph, as we shall see. If we are given a distribution that is expressed in terms of an undirected graph, then we can readily convert it to a factor graph. To do this, we create variable nodes corresponding to the nodes in the original undirected graph, and then create addi- tional factor nodes corresponding to the maximal cliques xs. The factors fs(xs) are then set equal to the clique potentials. Note that there may be several different factor graphs that correspond to the same undirected graph. These concepts are illustrated in Figure 8.41. Similarly, to convert a directed graph to a factor graph, we simply create variable nodes in the factor graph corresponding to the nodes of the directed graph, and then create factor nodes corresponding to the conditional distributions, and then \ufb01nally add the appropriate links. Again, there can be multiple factor graphs all of which correspond to the same directed graph. The conversion of a directed graph to a factor graph is illustrated in Figure 8.42. We have already noted the importance of tree-structured graphs for performing ef\ufb01cient inference. If we take a directed or undirected tree and convert it into a factor graph, then the result will again be a tree (in other words, the factor graph will have no loops, and there will be one and only one path connecting any two nodes). In the case of a directed polytree, conversion to an undirected graph results in loops due to the moralization step, whereas conversion to a factor graph again results in a tree, as illustrated in Figure 8.43. In fact, local cycles in a directed graph due to links connecting parents of a node can be removed on conversion to a factor graph by de\ufb01ning the appropriate factor function, as shown in Figure 8.44. We have seen that multiple different factor graphs can represent the same di- rected or undirected graph. This allows factor graphs to be more speci\ufb01c about the",

Here we shall focus on the problem of evaluating local marginals over nodes or subsets of nodes, which will lead us to the sum-product algorithm. Later we shall modify the technique to allow the most probable state to be found, giving rise to the max-sum algorithm. Also we shall suppose that all of the variables in the model are discrete, and so marginalization corresponds to performing sums. The framework, however, is equally applicable to linear-Gaussian models in which case marginalization involves integration, and we shall consider an example of this in detail when we discuss linear dynamical systems.

There is an algorithm for exact inference on directed graphs without loops known as belief propagation (Pearl, 1988; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988), and is equiv- alent to a special case of the sum-product algorithm. Here we shall consider only the sum-product algorithm because it is simpler to derive and to apply, as well as being more general. We shall assume that the original graph is an undirected tree or a directed tree or polytree, so that the corresponding factor graph has a tree structure. We \ufb01rst convert the original graph into a factor graph so that we can deal with both directed and undirected models using the same framework. Our goal is to exploit the structure of the graph to achieve two things: (i) to obtain an ef\ufb01cient, exact inference algorithm for \ufb01nding marginals; (ii) in situations where several marginals are required to allow computations to be shared ef\ufb01ciently. We begin by considering the problem of \ufb01nding the marginal p(x) for partic- ular variable node x. For the moment, we shall suppose that all of the variables are hidden. Later we shall see how to modify the algorithm to incorporate evidence corresponding to observed variables. By de\ufb01nition, the marginal is obtained by sum- ming the joint distribution over all variables except x so that p(x) = \u0002 x\\x p(x) (8.61) where x \\ x denotes the set of variables in x with variable x omitted. The idea is to substitute for p(x) using the factor graph expression (8.59) and then interchange summations and products in order to obtain an ef\ufb01cient algorithm. Consider the fragment of graph shown in Figure 8.46 in which we see that the tree structure of the graph allows us to partition the factors in the joint distribution into groups, with one group associated with each of the factor nodes that is a neighbour of the variable node x. We see that the joint distribution can be written as a product of the form p(x) = \u000e s\u2208ne(x) Fs(x, Xs) (8.62) ne(x) denotes the set of factor nodes that are neighbours of x, and Xs denotes the set of all variables in the subtree connected to the variable node x via the factor node",

In each case, we see that messages passed along a link are always a function of the variable associated with the variable node that link connects to. The result (8.66) says that to evaluate the message sent by a factor node to a vari- able node along the link connecting them, take the product of the incoming messages along all other links coming into the factor node, multiply by the factor associated with that node, and then marginalize over all of the variables associated with the incoming messages. This is illustrated in Figure 8.47. It is important to note that a factor node can send a message to a variable node once it has received incoming messages from all other neighbouring variable nodes. Finally, we derive an expression for evaluating the messages from variable nodes to factor nodes, again by making use of the (sub-)graph factorization. From Fig- ure 8.48, we see that term Gm(xm, Xsm) associated with node xm is given by a product of terms Fl(xm, Xml) each associated with one of the factor nodes fl that is linked to node xm (excluding node fs), so that Gm(xm, Xsm) = \u000e l\u2208ne(xm)\\fs Fl(xm, Xml) (8.68) where the product is taken over all neighbours of node xm except for node fs.

Thus to evaluate the message sent by a variable node to an adjacent factor node along the connecting link, we simply take the product of the incoming messages along all of the other links. Note that any variable node that has only two neighbours performs no computation but simply passes messages through un- changed. Also, we note that a variable node can send a message to a factor node once it has received incoming messages from all other neighbouring factor nodes. Recall that our goal is to calculate the marginal for variable node x, and that this marginal is given by the product of incoming messages along all of the links arriving at that node. Each of these messages can be computed recursively in terms of other messages. In order to start this recursion, we can view the node x as the root of the tree and begin at the leaf nodes. From the de\ufb01nition (8.69), we see that if a leaf node is a variable node, then the message that it sends along its one and only link is given by \u00b5x\u2192f(x) = 1 (8.70) as illustrated in Figure 8.49(a).

    "text": "8.4. Inference in Graphical Models 407 as illustrated in Figure 8.49(b). At this point, it is worth pausing to summarize the particular version of the sum- product algorithm obtained so far for evaluating the marginal p(x). We start by viewing the variable node x as the root of the factor graph and initiating messages at the leaves of the graph using (8.70) and (8.71). The message passing steps (8.66) and (8.69) are then applied recursively until messages have been propagated along every link, and the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours. Each node can send a message towards the root once it has received messages from all of its other neighbours. Once the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours, the required marginal can be evaluated using (8.63). We shall illustrate this process shortly. To see that each node will always receive enough messages to be able to send out a message, we can use a simple inductive argument as follows. Clearly, for a graph comprising a variable root node connected directly to several factor leaf nodes, the algorithm trivially involves sending messages of the form (8.71) directly from the leaves to the root. Now imagine building up a general graph by adding nodes one at a time, and suppose that for some particular graph we have a valid algorithm. When one more (variable or factor) node is added, it can be connected only by a single link because the overall graph must remain a tree, and so the new node will be a leaf node. It therefore sends a message to the node to which it is linked, which in turn will therefore receive all the messages it requires in order to send its own message towards the root, and so again we have a valid algorithm, thereby completing the proof. Now suppose we wish to \ufb01nd the marginals for every variable node in the graph. This could be done by simply running the above algorithm afresh for each such node. However, this would be very wasteful as many of the required computations would be repeated. We can obtain a much more ef\ufb01cient procedure by \u2018overlaying\u2019 these multiple message passing algorithms to obtain the general sum-product algorithm as follows. Arbitrarily pick any (variable or factor) node and designate it as the root. Propagate messages from the leaves to the root as before. At this point, the root node will have received messages from all of its neighbours. It can therefore send out messages to all of its neighbours. These in turn will then have received messages from all of their neighbours and so can send out messages along the links going away from the root, and so on. In this way, messages are passed outwards from the root all the way to the leaves. By now, a message will have passed in both directions across every link in the graph, and every node will have received a message from all of its neighbours. Again a simple inductive argument can be used to verify the validity of this message passing protocol. Because every variable Exercise 8.20 node will have received messages from all of its neighbours, we can readily calculate the marginal distribution for every variable in the graph. The number of messages that have to be computed is given by twice the number of links in the graph and so involves only twice the computation involved in \ufb01nding a single marginal. By comparison, if we had run the sum-product algorithm separately for each node, the amount of computation would grow quadratically with the size of the graph. Note that this algorithm is in fact independent of which node was designated as the root,",

In this example, the outgoing message shown by the blue arrow is obtained by taking the product of all the in- coming messages shown by green arrows, mul- tiplying by the factor fs, and marginalizing over the variables x1 and x2. fs x1 x2 x3 and indeed the notion of one node having a special status was introduced only as a convenient way to explain the message passing protocol. Next suppose we wish to \ufb01nd the marginal distributions p(xs) associated with the sets of variables belonging to each of the factors. By a similar argument to that used above, it is easy to see that the marginal associated with a factor is given by the Exercise 8.21 product of messages arriving at the factor node and the local factor at that node p(xs) = fs(xs) \u000e i\u2208ne(fs) \u00b5xi\u2192fs(xi) (8.72) in complete analogy with the marginals at the variable nodes. If the factors are parameterized functions and we wish to learn the values of the parameters using the EM algorithm, then these marginals are precisely the quantities we will need to calculate in the E step, as we shall see in detail when we discuss the hidden Markov model in Chapter 13. The message sent by a variable node to a factor node, as we have seen, is simply the product of the incoming messages on other links. We can if we wish view the sum-product algorithm in a slightly different form by eliminating messages from variable nodes to factor nodes and simply considering messages that are sent out by factor nodes. This is most easily seen by considering the example in Figure 8.50. So far, we have rather neglected the issue of normalization. If the factor graph was derived from a directed graph, then the joint distribution is already correctly nor- malized, and so the marginals obtained by the sum-product algorithm will similarly be normalized correctly. However, if we started from an undirected graph, then in general there will be an unknown normalization coef\ufb01cient 1/Z. As with the simple chain example of Figure 8.38, this is easily handled by working with an unnormal- ized version \u0004p(x) of the joint distribution, where p(x) = \u0004p(x)/Z. We \ufb01rst run the sum-product algorithm to \ufb01nd the corresponding unnormalized marginals \u0004p(xi). The coef\ufb01cient 1/Z is then easily obtained by normalizing any one of these marginals, and this is computationally ef\ufb01cient because the normalization is done over a single variable rather than over the entire set of variables as would be required to normalize \u0004p(x) directly. At this point, it may be helpful to consider a simple example to illustrate the operation of the sum-product algorithm. Figure 8.51 shows a simple 4-node factor",

Using (8.63) and substituting for the messages using the above results, we have \u0004p(x2) = \u00b5fa\u2192x2(x2)\u00b5fb\u2192x2(x2)\u00b5fc\u2192x2(x2) = \u0002 x1 fa(x1, x2) \u0002 x3 fb(x2, x3) \u0002 x4 fc(x2, x4) = \u0002 x1 \u0002 x2 \u0002 x4 fa(x1, x2)fb(x2, x3)fc(x2, x4) = \u0002 x1 \u0002 x3 \u0002 x4 \u0004p(x) (8.86) as required. So far, we have assumed that all of the variables in the graph are hidden. In most practical applications, a subset of the variables will be observed, and we wish to cal- culate posterior distributions conditioned on these observations. Observed nodes are easily handled within the sum-product algorithm as follows. Suppose we partition x into hidden variables h and observed variables v, and that the observed value of v is denoted \u0001v. Then we simply multiply the joint distribution p(x) by \u0015 i I(vi,\u0001vi), where I(v,\u0001v) = 1 if v = \u0001v and I(v,\u0001v) = 0 otherwise. This product corresponds to p(h, v = \u0001v) and hence is an unnormalized version of p(h|v = \u0001v). By run- ning the sum-product algorithm, we can ef\ufb01ciently calculate the posterior marginals p(hi|v = \u0001v) up to a normalization coef\ufb01cient whose value can be found ef\ufb01ciently using a local computation. Any summations over variables in v then collapse into a single term. We have assumed throughout this section that we are dealing with discrete vari- ables. However, there is nothing speci\ufb01c to discrete variables either in the graphical framework or in the probabilistic construction of the sum-product algorithm. For",

We shall give an example of the sum-product algorithm applied to a graph of linear-Gaussian variables when we consider linear dynamical systems. Section 13.3 8.4.5 The max-sum algorithm The sum-product algorithm allows us to take a joint distribution p(x) expressed as a factor graph and ef\ufb01ciently \ufb01nd marginals over the component variables. Two other common tasks are to \ufb01nd a setting of the variables that has the largest prob- ability and to \ufb01nd the value of that probability. These can be addressed through a closely related algorithm called max-sum, which can be viewed as an application of dynamic programming in the context of graphical models (Cormen et al., 2001). A simple approach to \ufb01nding latent variable values having high probability would be to run the sum-product algorithm to obtain the marginals p(xi) for ev- ery variable, and then, for each marginal in turn, to \ufb01nd the value x\u22c6 i that maximizes that marginal. However, this would give the set of values that are individually the most probable. In practice, we typically wish to \ufb01nd the set of values that jointly have the largest probability, in other words the vector xmax that maximizes the joint distribution, so that xmax = arg max x p(x) (8.87) for which the corresponding value of the joint probability will be given by p(xmax) = max x p(x). (8.88) In general, xmax is not the same as the set of x\u22c6 i values, as we can easily show using a simple example. Consider the joint distribution p(x, y) over two binary variables x, y \u2208{0, 1} given in Table 8.1. The joint distribution is maximized by setting x = 1 and y = 0, corresponding the value 0.4. However, the marginal for p(x), obtained by summing over both values of y, is given by p(x = 0) = 0.6 and p(x = 1) = 0.4, and similarly the marginal for y is given by p(y = 0) = 0.7 and p(y = 1) = 0.3, and so the marginals are maximized by x = 0 and y = 0, which corresponds to a value of 0.3 for the joint distribution. In fact, it is not dif\ufb01cult to construct examples for which the set of individually most probable values has probability zero under the joint distribution. Exercise 8.27 We therefore seek an ef\ufb01cient algorithm for \ufb01nding the value of x that maxi- mizes the joint distribution p(x) and that will allow us to obtain the value of the joint distribution at its maximum. To address the second of these problems, we shall simply write out the max operator in terms of its components max x p(x) = max x1 . . . max xM p(x) (8.89)",

In deriving the sum-product algorithm, we made use of the distributive law (8.53) for multiplication. Here we make use of the analogous law for the max operator max(ab, ac) = a max(b, c) (8.90) which holds if a \u2a7e0 (as will always be the case for the factors in a graphical model). This allows us to exchange products with maximizations. Consider \ufb01rst the simple example of a chain of nodes described by (8.49). The evaluation of the probability maximum can be written as max x p(x) = 1 Z max x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 max xN [\u03c81,2(x1, x2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c8N\u22121,N(xN\u22121, xN)] = 1 Z max x1 \u03c81,2(x1, x2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 max xN \u03c8N\u22121,N(xN\u22121, xN) . As with the calculation of marginals, we see that exchanging the max and product operators results in a much more ef\ufb01cient computation, and one that is easily inter- preted in terms of messages passed from node xN backwards along the chain to node x1. We can readily generalize this result to arbitrary tree-structured factor graphs by substituting the expression (8.59) for the factor graph expansion into (8.89) and again exchanging maximizations with products. The structure of this calculation is identical to that of the sum-product algorithm, and so we can simply translate those results into the present context. In particular, suppose that we designate a particular variable node as the \u2018root\u2019 of the graph. Then we start a set of messages propagating inwards from the leaves of the tree towards the root, with each node sending its message towards the root once it has received all incoming messages from its other neighbours. The \ufb01nal maximization is performed over the product of all messages arriving at the root node, and gives the maximum value for p(x). This could be called the max-product algorithm and is identical to the sum-product algorithm except that summations are replaced by maximizations. Note that at this stage, messages have been sent from leaves to the root, but not in the other direction. In practice, products of many small probabilities can lead to numerical under- \ufb02ow problems, and so it is convenient to work with the logarithm of the joint distri- bution. The logarithm is a monotonic function, so that if a > b then ln a > ln b, and hence the max operator and the logarithm function can be interchanged, so that ln \u0011 max x p(x) \u0012 = max x ln p(x). (8.91) The distributive property is preserved because max(a + b, a + c) = a + max(b, c). (8.92) Thus taking the logarithm simply has the effect of replacing the products in the max-product algorithm with sums, and so we obtain the max-sum algorithm. From",

(8.97) So far, we have seen how to \ufb01nd the maximum of the joint distribution by prop- agating messages from the leaves to an arbitrarily chosen root node. The result will be the same irrespective of which node is chosen as the root. Now we turn to the second problem of \ufb01nding the con\ufb01guration of the variables for which the joint dis- tribution attains this maximum value. So far, we have sent messages from the leaves to the root. The process of evaluating (8.97) will also give the value xmax for the most probable value of the root node variable, de\ufb01ned by xmax = arg max x \u23a1 \u23a3\u0002 s\u2208ne(x) \u00b5fs\u2192x(x) \u23a4 \u23a6.

However, because we are now maximizing rather than summing, it is possible that there may be mul- tiple con\ufb01gurations of x all of which give rise to the maximum value for p(x). In such cases, this strategy can fail because it is possible for the individual variable values obtained by maximizing the product of messages at each node to belong to different maximizing con\ufb01gurations, giving an overall con\ufb01guration that no longer corresponds to a maximum. The problem can be resolved by adopting a rather different kind of message passing from the root node to the leaves. To see how this works, let us return once again to the simple chain example of N variables x1, . . . , xN each having K states,",

For every state k of each variable xn (corresponding to column n of the dia- gram) the function \u03c6(xn) de\ufb01nes a unique state at the previous variable, indicated by the black lines. The two paths through the lattice correspond to con\ufb01gurations that give the global maximum of the joint probability distribution, and either of these can be found by tracing back along the black lines in the opposite direction to the arrow. k = 1 k = 2 k = 3 n \u22122 n \u22121 n n + 1 corresponding to the graph shown in Figure 8.38.

The initial message sent from the leaf node is simply \u00b5x1\u2192f1,2(x1) = 0. (8.99) The most probable value for xN is then given by xmax N = arg max xN \b \u00b5fN\u22121,N\u2192xN(xN) . (8.100) Now we need to determine the states of the previous variables that correspond to the same maximizing con\ufb01guration.

Note that this is not a probabilistic graphical model because the nodes represent individual states of variables, while each variable corresponds to a column of such states in the di- agram.

Once we know the most probable value of the \ufb01- nal node xN, we can then simply follow the link back to \ufb01nd the most probable state of node xN\u22121 and so on back to the initial node x1. This corresponds to propagating a message back down the chain using xmax n\u22121 = \u03c6(xmax n ) (8.102) and is known as back-tracking. Note that there could be several values of xn\u22121 all of which give the maximum value in (8.101). Provided we chose one of these values when we do the back-tracking, we are assured of a globally consistent maximizing con\ufb01guration. In Figure 8.53, we have indicated two paths, each of which we shall suppose corresponds to a global maximum of the joint probability distribution. If k = 2 and k = 3 each represent possible values of xmax N , then starting from either state and tracing back along the black lines, which corresponds to iterating (8.102), we obtain a valid global maximum con\ufb01guration. Note that if we had run a forward pass of max-sum message passing followed by a backward pass and then applied (8.98) at each node separately, we could end up selecting some states from one path and some from the other path, giving an overall con\ufb01guration that is not a global maximizer. We see that it is necessary instead to keep track of the maximizing states during the forward pass using the functions \u03c6(xn) and then use back-tracking to \ufb01nd a consistent solution. The extension to a general tree-structured factor graph should now be clear. If a message is sent from a factor node f to a variable node x, a maximization is performed over all other variable nodes x1, . . . , xM that are neighbours of that fac- tor node, using (8.93). When we perform this maximization, we keep a record of which values of the variables x1, . . . , xM gave rise to the maximum. Then in the back-tracking step, having found xmax, we can then use these stored values to as- sign consistent maximizing states xmax 1 , . . . , xmax M . The max-sum algorithm, with back-tracking, gives an exact maximizing con\ufb01guration for the variables provided the factor graph is a tree. An important application of this technique is for \ufb01nding the most probable sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model, in which case it is known as the Viterbi algorithm. Section 13.2 As with the sum-product algorithm, the inclusion of evidence in the form of observed variables is straightforward. The observed variables are clamped to their observed values, and the maximization is performed over the remaining hidden vari- ables. This can be shown formally by including identity functions for the observed variables into the factor functions, as we did for the sum-product algorithm. It is interesting to compare max-sum with the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm described on page 389. Each step in ICM is computationally simpler be- cause the \u2018messages\u2019 that are passed from one node to the next comprise a single value consisting of the new state of the node for which the conditional distribution is maximized. The max-sum algorithm is more complex because the messages are functions of node variables x and hence comprise a set of K values for each pos- sible state of x. Unlike max-sum, however, ICM is not guaranteed to \ufb01nd a global maximum even for tree-structured graphs.",

GRAPHICAL MODELS 8.4.6 Exact inference in general graphs The sum-product and max-sum algorithms provide ef\ufb01cient and exact solutions to inference problems in tree-structured graphs. For many practical applications, however, we have to deal with graphs having loops. The message passing framework can be generalized to arbitrary graph topolo- gies, giving an exact inference procedure known as the junction tree algorithm (Lau- ritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Jordan, 2007). Here we give a brief outline of the key steps involved. This is not intended to convey a detailed understanding of the algorithm, but rather to give a \ufb02avour of the various stages involved. If the starting point is a directed graph, it is \ufb01rst converted to an undirected graph by moraliza- tion, whereas if starting from an undirected graph this step is not required. Next the graph is triangulated, which involves \ufb01nding chord-less cycles containing four or more nodes and adding extra links to eliminate such chord-less cycles. For instance, in the graph in Figure 8.36, the cycle A\u2013C\u2013B\u2013D\u2013A is chord-less a link could be added between A and B or alternatively between C and D. Note that the joint dis- tribution for the resulting triangulated graph is still de\ufb01ned by a product of the same potential functions, but these are now considered to be functions over expanded sets of variables. Next the triangulated graph is used to construct a new tree-structured undirected graph called a join tree, whose nodes correspond to the maximal cliques of the triangulated graph, and whose links connect pairs of cliques that have vari- ables in common. The selection of which pairs of cliques to connect in this way is important and is done so as to give a maximal spanning tree de\ufb01ned as follows. Of all possible trees that link up the cliques, the one that is chosen is one for which the weight of the tree is largest, where the weight for a link is the number of nodes shared by the two cliques it connects, and the weight for the tree is the sum of the weights for the links. If the tree is condensed, so that any clique that is a subset of another clique is absorbed into the larger clique, this gives a junction tree. As a consequence of the triangulation step, the resulting tree satis\ufb01es the running intersection property, which means that if a variable is contained in two cliques, then it must also be con- tained in every clique on the path that connects them. This ensures that inference about variables will be consistent across the graph. Finally, a two-stage message passing algorithm, essentially equivalent to the sum-product algorithm, can now be applied to this junction tree in order to \ufb01nd marginals and conditionals. Although the junction tree algorithm sounds complicated, at its heart is the simple idea that we have used already of exploiting the factorization properties of the distribution to allow sums and products to be interchanged so that partial summations can be per- formed, thereby avoiding having to work directly with the joint distribution. The role of the junction tree is to provide a precise and ef\ufb01cient way to organize these computations. It is worth emphasizing that this is achieved using purely graphical operations! The junction tree is exact for arbitrary graphs and is ef\ufb01cient in the sense that for a given graph there does not in general exist a computationally cheaper approach. Unfortunately, the algorithm must work with the joint distributions within each node (each of which corresponds to a clique of the triangulated graph) and so the compu- tational cost of the algorithm is determined by the number of variables in the largest",

An important concept is the treewidth of a graph (Bodlaender, 1993), which is de- \ufb01ned in terms of the number of variables in the largest clique. In fact, it is de\ufb01ned to be as one less than the size of the largest clique, to ensure that a tree has a treewidth of 1. Because there in general there can be multiple different junction trees that can be constructed from a given starting graph, the treewidth is de\ufb01ned by the junction tree for which the largest clique has the fewest variables. If the treewidth of the original graph is high, the junction tree algorithm becomes impractical. 8.4.7 Loopy belief propagation For many problems of practical interest, it will not be feasible to use exact in- ference, and so we need to exploit effective approximation methods. An important class of such approximations, that can broadly be called variational methods, will be discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Complementing these deterministic approaches is a wide range of sampling methods, also called Monte Carlo methods, that are based on stochastic numerical sampling from distributions and that will be discussed at length in Chapter 11. Here we consider one simple approach to approximate inference in graphs with loops, which builds directly on the previous discussion of exact inference in trees. The idea is simply to apply the sum-product algorithm even though there is no guar- antee that it will yield good results. This approach is known as loopy belief propa- gation (Frey and MacKay, 1998) and is possible because the message passing rules (8.66) and (8.69) for the sum-product algorithm are purely local. However, because the graph now has cycles, information can \ufb02ow many times around the graph. For some models, the algorithm will converge, whereas for others it will not. In order to apply this approach, we need to de\ufb01ne a message passing schedule. Let us assume that one message is passed at a time on any given link and in any given direction. Each message sent from a node replaces any previous message sent in the same direction across the same link and will itself be a function only of the most recent messages received by that node at previous steps of the algorithm. We have seen that a message can only be sent across a link from a node when all other messages have been received by that node across its other links. Because there are loops in the graph, this raises the problem of how to initiate the message passing algorithm. To resolve this, we suppose that an initial message given by the unit function has been passed across every link in each direction. Every node is then in a position to send a message. There are now many possible ways to organize the message passing schedule. For example, the \ufb02ooding schedule simultaneously passes a message across every link in both directions at each time step, whereas schedules that pass one message at a time are called serial schedules. Following Kschischnang et al. (2001), we will say that a (variable or factor) node a has a message pending on its link to a node b if node a has received any message on any of its other links since the last time it send a message to b. Thus, when a node receives a message on one of its links, this creates pending messages on all of its other links. Only pending messages need to be transmitted because",

    "text": "418 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS other messages would simply duplicate the previous message on the same link. For graphs that have a tree structure, any schedule that sends only pending messages will eventually terminate once a message has passed in each direction across every link. At this point, there are no pending messages, and the product of the received Exercise 8.29 messages at every variable give the exact marginal. In graphs having loops, however, the algorithm may never terminate because there might always be pending messages, although in practice it is generally found to converge within a reasonable time for most applications. Once the algorithm has converged, or once it has been stopped if convergence is not observed, the (approximate) local marginals can be computed using the product of the most recently received incoming messages to each variable node or factor node on every link. In some applications, the loopy belief propagation algorithm can give poor re- sults, whereas in other applications it has proven to be very effective. In particular, state-of-the-art algorithms for decoding certain kinds of error-correcting codes are equivalent to loopy belief propagation (Gallager, 1963; Berrou et al., 1993; McEliece et al., 1998; MacKay and Neal, 1999; Frey, 1998). 8.4.8 Learning the graph structure In our discussion of inference in graphical models, we have assumed that the structure of the graph is known and \ufb01xed. However, there is also interest in go- ing beyond the inference problem and learning the graph structure itself from data (Friedman and Koller, 2003). This requires that we de\ufb01ne a space of possible struc- tures as well as a measure that can be used to score each structure. From a Bayesian viewpoint, we would ideally like to compute a posterior dis- tribution over graph structures and to make predictions by averaging with respect to this distribution. If we have a prior p(m) over graphs indexed by m, then the posterior distribution is given by p(m|D) \u221dp(m)p(D|m) (8.103) where D is the observed data set. The model evidence p(D|m) then provides the score for each model. However, evaluation of the evidence involves marginalization over the latent variables and presents a challenging computational problem for many models. Exploring the space of structures can also be problematic. Because the number of different graph structures grows exponentially with the number of nodes, it is often necessary to resort to heuristics to \ufb01nd good candidates.

This allows relatively complex marginal distributions over observed variables to be ex- pressed in terms of more tractable joint distributions over the expanded space of observed and latent variables. The introduction of latent variables thereby allows complicated distributions to be formed from simpler components. In this chapter, we shall see that mixture distributions, such as the Gaussian mixture discussed in Section 2.3.9, can be interpreted in terms of discrete latent variables. Continuous latent variables will form the subject of Chapter 12. As well as providing a framework for building more complex probability dis- tributions, mixture models can also be used to cluster data. We therefore begin our discussion of mixture distributions by considering the problem of \ufb01nding clusters in a set of data points, which we approach \ufb01rst using a nonprobabilistic technique called the K-means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982).

A gen- Section 9.2 eral technique for \ufb01nding maximum likelihood estimators in latent variable models is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We \ufb01rst of all use the Gaussian mixture distribution to motivate the EM algorithm in a fairly informal way, and then we give a more careful treatment based on the latent variable viewpoint. We shall Section 9.3 see that the K-means algorithm corresponds to a particular nonprobabilistic limit of EM applied to mixtures of Gaussians. Finally, we discuss EM in some generality. Section 9.4 Gaussian mixture models are widely used in data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning, and statistical analysis. In many applications, their parameters are determined by maximum likelihood, typically using the EM algorithm. However, as we shall see there are some signi\ufb01cant limitations to the maximum likelihood ap- proach, and in Chapter 10 we shall show that an elegant Bayesian treatment can be given using the framework of variational inference. This requires little additional computation compared with EM, and it resolves the principal dif\ufb01culties of maxi- mum likelihood while also allowing the number of components in the mixture to be inferred automatically from the data. 9.1. K-means Clustering We begin by considering the problem of identifying groups, or clusters, of data points in a multidimensional space. Suppose we have a data set {x1, . . . , xN} consisting of N observations of a random D-dimensional Euclidean variable x. Our goal is to partition the data set into some number K of clusters, where we shall suppose for the moment that the value of K is given. Intuitively, we might think of a cluster as comprising a group of data points whose inter-point distances are small compared with the distances to points outside of the cluster. We can formalize this notion by \ufb01rst introducing a set of D-dimensional vectors \u00b5k, where k = 1, . . . , K, in which \u00b5k is a prototype associated with the kth cluster. As we shall see shortly, we can think of the \u00b5k as representing the centres of the clusters. Our goal is then to \ufb01nd an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of vectors {\u00b5k}, such that the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest vector \u00b5k, is a minimum. It is convenient at this point to de\ufb01ne some notation to describe the assignment of data points to clusters. For each data point xn, we introduce a corresponding set of binary indicator variables rnk \u2208{0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K describing which of the K clusters the data point xn is assigned to, so that if data point xn is assigned to cluster k then rnk = 1, and rnj = 0 for j \u0338= k. This is known as the 1-of-K coding scheme. We can then de\ufb01ne an objective function, sometimes called a distortion measure, given by J = N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 rnk\u2225xn \u2212\u00b5k\u22252 (9.1) which represents the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its",

We can do this through an iterative procedure in which each iteration involves two successive steps corresponding to successive optimizations with respect to the rnk and the \u00b5k. First we choose some initial values for the \u00b5k. Then in the \ufb01rst phase we minimize J with respect to the rnk, keeping the \u00b5k \ufb01xed. In the second phase we minimize J with respect to the \u00b5k, keeping rnk \ufb01xed. This two-stage optimization is then repeated until convergence. We shall see that these two stages of updating rnk and updating \u00b5k correspond respectively to the E (expectation) and M (maximization) steps of the EM algorithm, and to emphasize this we shall use the Section 9.4 terms E step and M step in the context of the K-means algorithm. Consider \ufb01rst the determination of the rnk. Because J in (9.1) is a linear func- tion of rnk, this optimization can be performed easily to give a closed form solution. The terms involving different n are independent and so we can optimize for each n separately by choosing rnk to be 1 for whichever value of k gives the minimum value of \u2225xn \u2212\u00b5k\u22252. In other words, we simply assign the nth data point to the closest cluster centre. More formally, this can be expressed as rnk = 1 if k = arg minj \u2225xn \u2212\u00b5j\u22252 0 otherwise. (9.2) Now consider the optimization of the \u00b5k with the rnk held \ufb01xed. The objective function J is a quadratic function of \u00b5k, and it can be minimized by setting its derivative with respect to \u00b5k to zero giving 2 N \u0002 n=1 rnk(xn \u2212\u00b5k) = 0 (9.3) which we can easily solve for \u00b5k to give \u00b5k = \u0005 n rnkxn \u0005 n rnk . (9.4) The denominator in this expression is equal to the number of points assigned to cluster k, and so this result has a simple interpretation, namely set \u00b5k equal to the mean of all of the data points xn assigned to cluster k. For this reason, the procedure is known as the K-means algorithm. The two phases of re-assigning data points to clusters and re-computing the clus- ter means are repeated in turn until there is no further change in the assignments (or until some maximum number of iterations is exceeded). Because each phase reduces the value of the objective function J, convergence of the algorithm is assured. How- Exercise 9.1 ever, it may converge to a local rather than global minimum of J. The convergence properties of the K-means algorithm were studied by MacQueen (1967). The K-means algorithm is illustrated using the Old Faithful data set in Fig- Appendix A ure 9.1. For the purposes of this example, we have made a linear re-scaling of the data, known as standardizing, such that each of the variables has zero mean and unit standard deviation. For this example, we have chosen K = 2, and so in this",

A plot of the cost function J given by (9.1) for the Old Faithful example is shown in Figure 9.2. Note that we have deliberately chosen poor initial values for the cluster centres so that the algorithm takes several steps before convergence. In practice, a better initialization procedure would be to choose the cluster centres \u00b5k to be equal to a random subset of K data points. It is also worth noting that the K-means algorithm itself is often used to initialize the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model before applying the EM algorithm. Section 9.2.2 A direct implementation of the K-means algorithm as discussed here can be relatively slow, because in each E step it is necessary to compute the Euclidean dis- tance between every prototype vector and every data point. Various schemes have been proposed for speeding up the K-means algorithm, some of which are based on precomputing a data structure such as a tree such that nearby points are in the same subtree (Ramasubramanian and Paliwal, 1990; Moore, 2000). Other approaches make use of the triangle inequality for distances, thereby avoiding unnecessary dis- tance calculations (Hodgson, 1998; Elkan, 2003). So far, we have considered a batch version of K-means in which the whole data set is used together to update the prototype vectors. We can also derive an on-line stochastic algorithm (MacQueen, 1967) by applying the Robbins-Monro procedure Section 2.3.5 to the problem of \ufb01nding the roots of the regression function given by the derivatives of J in (9.1) with respect to \u00b5k. This leads to a sequential update in which, for each Exercise 9.2 data point xn in turn, we update the nearest prototype \u00b5k using \u00b5new k = \u00b5old k + \u03b7n(xn \u2212\u00b5old k ) (9.5) where \u03b7n is the learning rate parameter, which is typically made to decrease mono- tonically as more data points are considered. The K-means algorithm is based on the use of squared Euclidean distance as the measure of dissimilarity between a data point and a prototype vector. Not only does this limit the type of data variables that can be considered (it would be inappropriate for cases where some or all of the variables represent categorical labels for instance),",

    "text": "428 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM but it can also make the determination of the cluster means nonrobust to outliers. We Section 2.3.7 can generalize the K-means algorithm by introducing a more general dissimilarity measure V(x, x\u2032) between two vectors x and x\u2032 and then minimizing the following distortion measure \u0004J = N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 rnkV(xn, \u00b5k) (9.6) which gives the K-medoids algorithm. The E step again involves, for given cluster prototypes \u00b5k, assigning each data point to the cluster for which the dissimilarity to the corresponding prototype is smallest. The computational cost of this is O(KN), as is the case for the standard K-means algorithm. For a general choice of dissimi- larity measure, the M step is potentially more complex than for K-means, and so it is common to restrict each cluster prototype to be equal to one of the data vectors as- signed to that cluster, as this allows the algorithm to be implemented for any choice of dissimilarity measure V(\u00b7, \u00b7) so long as it can be readily evaluated. Thus the M step involves, for each cluster k, a discrete search over the Nk points assigned to that cluster, which requires O(N 2 k) evaluations of V(\u00b7, \u00b7). One notable feature of the K-means algorithm is that at each iteration, every data point is assigned uniquely to one, and only one, of the clusters. Whereas some data points will be much closer to a particular centre \u00b5k than to any other centre, there may be other data points that lie roughly midway between cluster centres. In the latter case, it is not clear that the hard assignment to the nearest cluster is the most appropriate. We shall see in the next section that by adopting a probabilistic approach, we obtain \u2018soft\u2019 assignments of data points to clusters in a way that re\ufb02ects the level of uncertainty over the most appropriate assignment. This probabilistic formulation brings with it numerous bene\ufb01ts. 9.1.1 Image segmentation and compression As an illustration of the application of the K-means algorithm, we consider the related problems of image segmentation and image compression. The goal of segmentation is to partition an image into regions each of which has a reasonably homogeneous visual appearance or which corresponds to objects or parts of objects (Forsyth and Ponce, 2003). Each pixel in an image is a point in a 3-dimensional space comprising the intensities of the red, blue, and green channels, and our segmentation algorithm simply treats each pixel in the image as a separate data point. Note that strictly this space is not Euclidean because the channel intensities are bounded by the interval [0, 1]. Nevertheless, we can apply the K-means algorithm without dif\ufb01- culty. We illustrate the result of running K-means to convergence, for any particular value of K, by re-drawing the image replacing each pixel vector with the {R, G, B} intensity triplet given by the centre \u00b5k to which that pixel has been assigned. Results for various values of K are shown in Figure 9.3. We see that for a given value of K, the algorithm is representing the image using a palette of only K colours. It should be emphasized that this use of K-means is not a particularly sophisticated approach to image segmentation, not least because it takes no account of the spatial proximity of different pixels. The image segmentation problem is in general extremely dif\ufb01cult",

This also illustrates of the use of vector quantization for data compression, in which smaller values of K give higher compression at the expense of poorer image quality. and remains the subject of active research and is introduced here simply to illustrate the behaviour of the K-means algorithm. We can also use the result of a clustering algorithm to perform data compres- sion. It is important to distinguish between lossless data compression, in which the goal is to be able to reconstruct the original data exactly from the compressed representation, and lossy data compression, in which we accept some errors in the reconstruction in return for higher levels of compression than can be achieved in the lossless case. We can apply the K-means algorithm to the problem of lossy data compression as follows. For each of the N data points, we store only the identity k of the cluster to which it is assigned. We also store the values of the K clus- ter centres \u00b5k, which typically requires signi\ufb01cantly less data, provided we choose K \u226aN. Each data point is then approximated by its nearest centre \u00b5k. New data points can similarly be compressed by \ufb01rst \ufb01nding the nearest \u00b5k and then storing the label k instead of the original data vector. This framework is often called vector quantization, and the vectors \u00b5k are called code-book vectors.",

Suppose the original image has N pixels comprising {R, G, B} values each of which is stored with 8 bits of precision. Then to transmit the whole image directly would cost 24N bits. Now suppose we \ufb01rst run K-means on the image data, and then instead of transmitting the original pixel intensity vectors we transmit the identity of the nearest vector \u00b5k. Because there are K such vectors, this requires log2 K bits per pixel. We must also transmit the K code book vectors \u00b5k, which requires 24K bits, and so the total number of bits required to transmit the image is 24K + N log2 K (rounding up to the nearest integer). The original image shown in Figure 9.3 has 240 \u00d7 180 = 43, 200 pixels and so requires 24 \u00d7 43, 200 = 1, 036, 800 bits to transmit directly. By comparison, the compressed images require 43, 248 bits (K = 2), 86, 472 bits (K = 3), and 173, 040 bits (K = 10), respectively, to transmit. These represent compression ratios compared to the original image of 4.2%, 8.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. We see that there is a trade-off between degree of compression and image quality. Note that our aim in this example is to illustrate the K-means algorithm. If we had been aiming to produce a good image compressor, then it would be more fruitful to consider small blocks of adjacent pixels, for instance 5\u00d75, and thereby exploit the correlations that exist in natural images between nearby pixels. 9.2. Mixtures of Gaussians In Section 2.3.9 we motivated the Gaussian mixture model as a simple linear super- position of Gaussian components, aimed at providing a richer class of density mod- els than the single Gaussian. We now turn to a formulation of Gaussian mixtures in terms of discrete latent variables. This will provide us with a deeper insight into this important distribution, and will also serve to motivate the expectation-maximization algorithm. Recall from (2.188) that the Gaussian mixture distribution can be written as a linear superposition of Gaussians in the form p(x) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0kN(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k). (9.7) Let us introduce a K-dimensional binary random variable z having a 1-of-K repre- sentation in which a particular element zk is equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0. The values of zk therefore satisfy zk \u2208{0, 1} and \u0005 k zk = 1, and we see that there are K possible states for the vector z according to which element is nonzero. We shall de\ufb01ne the joint distribution p(x, z) in terms of a marginal dis- tribution p(z) and a conditional distribution p(x|z), corresponding to the graphical model in Figure 9.4. The marginal distribution over z is speci\ufb01ed in terms of the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0k, such that p(zk = 1) = \u03c0k",

Because z uses a 1-of-K representation, we can also write this distribution in the form p(z) = K \u000e k=1 \u03c0zk k . (9.10) Similarly, the conditional distribution of x given a particular value for z is a Gaussian p(x|zk = 1) = N(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) which can also be written in the form p(x|z) = K \u000e k=1 N(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k)zk. (9.11) The joint distribution is given by p(z)p(x|z), and the marginal distribution of x is then obtained by summing the joint distribution over all possible states of z to give Exercise 9.3 p(x) = \u0002 z p(z)p(x|z) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0kN(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) (9.12) where we have made use of (9.10) and (9.11). Thus the marginal distribution of x is a Gaussian mixture of the form (9.7). If we have several observations x1, . . . , xN, then, because we have represented the marginal distribution in the form p(x) = \u0005 z p(x, z), it follows that for every observed data point xn there is a corresponding latent variable zn. We have therefore found an equivalent formulation of the Gaussian mixture in- volving an explicit latent variable. It might seem that we have not gained much by doing so. However, we are now able to work with the joint distribution p(x, z)",

As we shall see later, \u03b3(zk) can also be viewed as the responsibility that component k takes for \u2018explain- ing\u2019 the observation x. We can use the technique of ancestral sampling to generate random samples Section 8.1.2 distributed according to the Gaussian mixture model. To do this, we \ufb01rst generate a value for z, which we denote \u0001z, from the marginal distribution p(z) and then generate a value for x from the conditional distribution p(x|\u0001z). Techniques for sampling from standard distributions are discussed in Chapter 11. We can depict samples from the joint distribution p(x, z) by plotting points at the corresponding values of x and then colouring them according to the value of z, in other words according to which Gaussian component was responsible for generating them, as shown in Figure 9.5(a). Similarly samples from the marginal distribution p(x) are obtained by taking the samples from the joint distribution and ignoring the values of z. These are illustrated in Figure 9.5(b) by plotting the x values without any coloured labels. We can also use this synthetic data set to illustrate the \u2018responsibilities\u2019 by eval- uating, for every data point, the posterior probability for each component in the mixture distribution from which this data set was generated. In particular, we can represent the value of the responsibilities \u03b3(znk) associated with data point xn by plotting the corresponding point using proportions of red, blue, and green ink given by \u03b3(znk) for k = 1, 2, 3, respectively, as shown in Figure 9.5(c). So, for instance, a data point for which \u03b3(zn1) = 1 will be coloured red, whereas one for which \u03b3(zn2) = \u03b3(zn3) = 0.5 will be coloured with equal proportions of blue and green ink and so will appear cyan. This should be compared with Figure 9.5(a) in which the data points were labelled using the true identity of the component from which they were generated. 9.2.1 Maximum likelihood Suppose we have a data set of observations {x1, . . . , xN}, and we wish to model this data using a mixture of Gaussians.

This data point will then contribute a term in the likelihood function of the form N(xn|xn, \u03c32 jI) = 1 (2\u03c0)1/2 1 \u03c3j . (9.15) If we consider the limit \u03c3j \u21920, then we see that this term goes to in\ufb01nity and so the log likelihood function will also go to in\ufb01nity. Thus the maximization of the log likelihood function is not a well posed problem because such singularities will always be present and will occur whenever one of the Gaussian components \u2018collapses\u2019 onto a speci\ufb01c data point. Recall that this problem did not arise in the case of a single Gaussian distribution. To understand the difference, note that if a single Gaussian collapses onto a data point it will contribute multiplicative factors to the likelihood function arising from the other data points and these factors will go to zero exponentially fast, giving an overall likelihood that goes to zero rather than in\ufb01nity. However, once we have (at least) two components in the mixture, one of the components can have a \ufb01nite variance and therefore assign \ufb01nite probability to all of the data points while the other component can shrink onto one speci\ufb01c data point and thereby contribute an ever increasing additive value to the log likelihood. This is illustrated in Figure 9.7. These singularities provide another example of the severe over-\ufb01tting that can occur in a maximum likelihood approach. We shall see that this dif\ufb01culty does not occur if we adopt a Bayesian approach. For the moment, Section 10.1 however, we simply note that in applying maximum likelihood to Gaussian mixture models we must take steps to avoid \ufb01nding such pathological solutions and instead seek local maxima of the likelihood function that are well behaved. We can hope to avoid the singularities by using suitable heuristics, for instance by detecting when a Gaussian component is collapsing and resetting its mean to a randomly chosen value while also resetting its covariance to some large value, and then continuing with the optimization. A further issue in \ufb01nding maximum likelihood solutions arises from the fact that for any given maximum likelihood solution, a K-component mixture will have a total of K! equivalent solutions corresponding to the K! ways of assigning K sets of parameters to K components. In other words, for any given (nondegenerate) point in the space of parameter values there will be a further K!\u22121 additional points all of which give rise to exactly the same distribution.

Identi\ufb01ability will also arise when we discuss models having continuous latent variables in Chapter 12. However, for the purposes of \ufb01nding a good density model, it is irrelevant because any of the equivalent solutions is as good as any other. Maximizing the log likelihood function (9.14) for a Gaussian mixture model turns out to be a more complex problem than for the case of a single Gaussian. The dif\ufb01culty arises from the presence of the summation over k that appears inside the logarithm in (9.14), so that the logarithm function no longer acts directly on the Gaussian. If we set the derivatives of the log likelihood to zero, we will no longer obtain a closed form solution, as we shall see shortly. One approach is to apply gradient-based optimization techniques (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Although gradient-based techniques are feasible, and indeed will play an important role when we discuss mixture density networks in Chapter 5, we now consider an alternative approach known as the EM algorithm which has broad applicability and which will lay the foundations for a discussion of variational inference techniques in Chapter 10. 9.2.2 EM for Gaussian mixtures An elegant and powerful method for \ufb01nding maximum likelihood solutions for models with latent variables is called the expectation-maximization algorithm, or EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997). Later we shall give a general treatment of EM, and we shall also show how EM can be generalized to obtain the variational inference framework. Initially, we shall motivate the EM Section 10.1 algorithm by giving a relatively informal treatment in the context of the Gaussian mixture model. We emphasize, however, that EM has broad applicability, and indeed it will be encountered in the context of a variety of different models in this book. Let us begin by writing down the conditions that must be satis\ufb01ed at a maximum of the likelihood function. Setting the derivatives of ln p(X|\u03c0, \u00b5, \u03a3) in (9.14) with respect to the means \u00b5k of the Gaussian components to zero, we obtain 0 = \u2212 N \u0002 n=1 \u03c0kN(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) \u0005 j \u03c0jN(xn|\u00b5j, \u03a3j) ( )* + \u03b3(znk) \u03a3k(xn \u2212\u00b5k) (9.16) where we have made use of the form (2.43) for the Gaussian distribution. Note that the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, given by (9.13) appear naturally on the right-hand side. Multiplying by \u03a3\u22121 k (which we assume to be nonsingular) and rearranging we obtain \u00b5k = 1 Nk N \u0002 n=1 \u03b3(znk)xn (9.17) where we have de\ufb01ned Nk = N \u0002 n=1 \u03b3(znk).

We see that the mean \u00b5k for the kth Gaussian component is obtained by taking a weighted mean of all of the points in the data set, in which the weighting factor for data point xn is given by the posterior probability \u03b3(znk) that component k was responsible for generating xn. If we set the derivative of ln p(X|\u03c0, \u00b5, \u03a3) with respect to \u03a3k to zero, and follow a similar line of reasoning, making use of the result for the maximum likelihood solution for the covariance matrix of a single Gaussian, we obtain Section 2.3.4 \u03a3k = 1 Nk N \u0002 n=1 \u03b3(znk)(xn \u2212\u00b5k)(xn \u2212\u00b5k)T (9.19) which has the same form as the corresponding result for a single Gaussian \ufb01tted to the data set, but again with each data point weighted by the corresponding poste- rior probability and with the denominator given by the effective number of points associated with the corresponding component. Finally, we maximize ln p(X|\u03c0, \u00b5, \u03a3) with respect to the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0k. Here we must take account of the constraint (9.9), which requires the mixing coef\ufb01cients to sum to one. This can be achieved using a Lagrange multiplier and Appendix E maximizing the following quantity ln p(X|\u03c0, \u00b5, \u03a3) + \u03bb \u0016 K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0k \u22121 \u0017 (9.20) which gives 0 = N \u0002 n=1 N(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) \u0005 j \u03c0jN(xn|\u00b5j, \u03a3j) + \u03bb (9.21) where again we see the appearance of the responsibilities. If we now multiply both sides by \u03c0k and sum over k making use of the constraint (9.9), we \ufb01nd \u03bb = \u2212N. Using this to eliminate \u03bb and rearranging we obtain \u03c0k = Nk N (9.22) so that the mixing coef\ufb01cient for the kth component is given by the average respon- sibility which that component takes for explaining the data points. It is worth emphasizing that the results (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) do not con- stitute a closed-form solution for the parameters of the mixture model because the responsibilities \u03b3(znk) depend on those parameters in a complex way through (9.13). However, these results do suggest a simple iterative scheme for \ufb01nding a solution to the maximum likelihood problem, which as we shall see turns out to be an instance of the EM algorithm for the particular case of the Gaussian mixture model. We \ufb01rst choose some initial values for the means, covariances, and mixing coef\ufb01cients. Then we alternate between the following two updates that we shall call the E step",

In practice, the algorithm is deemed to have converged when the change Section 9.4 in the log likelihood function, or alternatively in the parameters, falls below some threshold. We illustrate the EM algorithm for a mixture of two Gaussians applied to the rescaled Old Faithful data set in Figure 9.8.

Thus, points that have a signi\ufb01cant probability for belonging to either cluster appear purple. The situation after the \ufb01rst M step is shown in plot (c), in which the mean of the blue Gaussian has moved to the mean of the data set, weighted by the probabilities of each data point belonging to the blue cluster, in other words it has moved to the centre of mass of the blue ink. Similarly, the covariance of the blue Gaussian is set equal to the covariance of the blue ink. Analogous results hold for the red component. Plots (d), (e), and (f) show the results after 2, 5, and 20 complete cycles of EM, respectively. In plot (f) the algorithm is close to convergence. Note that the EM algorithm takes many more iterations to reach (approximate) convergence compared with the K-means algorithm, and that each cycle requires signi\ufb01cantly more computation. It is therefore common to run the K-means algo- rithm in order to \ufb01nd a suitable initialization for a Gaussian mixture model that is subsequently adapted using EM. The covariance matrices can conveniently be ini- tialized to the sample covariances of the clusters found by the K-means algorithm, and the mixing coef\ufb01cients can be set to the fractions of data points assigned to the respective clusters. As with gradient-based approaches for maximizing the log like- lihood, techniques must be employed to avoid singularities of the likelihood function in which a Gaussian component collapses onto a particular data point. It should be emphasized that there will generally be multiple local maxima of the log likelihood function, and that EM is not guaranteed to \ufb01nd the largest of these maxima. Because the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures plays such an important role, we summarize it below.

The goal of the EM algorithm is to \ufb01nd maximum likelihood solutions for mod- els having latent variables. We denote the set of all observed data by X, in which the nth row represents xT n, and similarly we denote the set of all latent variables by Z, with a corresponding row zT n. The set of all model parameters is denoted by \u03b8, and so the log likelihood function is given by ln p(X|\u03b8) = ln \u0018\u0002 Z p(X, Z|\u03b8) \u0019 . (9.29) Note that our discussion will apply equally well to continuous latent variables simply by replacing the sum over Z with an integral.

The presence of the sum prevents the logarithm from acting directly on the joint distribution, resulting in complicated expressions for the maximum likelihood solution. Now suppose that, for each observation in X, we were told the corresponding value of the latent variable Z. We shall call {X, Z} the complete data set, and we shall refer to the actual observed data X as incomplete, as illustrated in Figure 9.5. The likelihood function for the complete data set simply takes the form ln p(X, Z|\u03b8), and we shall suppose that maximization of this complete-data log likelihood function is straightforward. In practice, however, we are not given the complete data set {X, Z}, but only the incomplete data X. Our state of knowledge of the values of the latent variables in Z is given only by the posterior distribution p(Z|X, \u03b8). Because we cannot use the complete-data log likelihood, we consider instead its expected value under the posterior distribution of the latent variable, which corresponds (as we shall see) to the E step of the EM algorithm. In the subsequent M step, we maximize this expectation. If the current estimate for the parameters is denoted \u03b8old, then a pair of successive E and M steps gives rise to a revised estimate \u03b8new. The algorithm is initialized by choosing some starting value for the parameters \u03b80. The use of the expectation may seem somewhat arbitrary. However, we shall see the motivation for this choice when we give a deeper treatment of EM in Section 9.4. In the E step, we use the current parameter values \u03b8old to \ufb01nd the posterior distribution of the latent variables given by p(Z|X, \u03b8old). We then use this posterior distribution to \ufb01nd the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood evaluated for some general parameter value \u03b8. This expectation, denoted Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old), is given by Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = \u0002 Z p(Z|X, \u03b8old) ln p(X, Z|\u03b8).

The EM algorithm can also be used to \ufb01nd MAP (maximum posterior) solutions for models in which a prior p(\u03b8) is de\ufb01ned over the parameters. In this case the E Exercise 9.4 step remains the same as in the maximum likelihood case, whereas in the M step the quantity to be maximized is given by Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) + ln p(\u03b8). Suitable choices for the prior will remove the singularities of the kind illustrated in Figure 9.7. Here we have considered the use of the EM algorithm to maximize a likelihood function when there are discrete latent variables. However, it can also be applied when the unobserved variables correspond to missing values in the data set. The distribution of the observed values is obtained by taking the joint distribution of all the variables and then marginalizing over the missing ones. EM can then be used to maximize the corresponding likelihood function. We shall show an example of the application of this technique in the context of principal component analysis in Figure 12.11. This will be a valid procedure if the data values are missing at random, meaning that the mechanism causing values to be missing does not depend on the unobserved values. In many situations this will not be the case, for instance if a sensor fails to return a value whenever the quantity it is measuring exceeds some threshold. 9.3.1 Gaussian mixtures revisited We now consider the application of this latent variable view of EM to the spe- ci\ufb01c case of a Gaussian mixture model. Recall that our goal is to maximize the log likelihood function (9.14), which is computed using the observed data set X, and we saw that this was more dif\ufb01cult than for the case of a single Gaussian distribution due to the presence of the summation over k that occurs inside the logarithm. Sup- pose then that in addition to the observed data set X, we were also given the values of the corresponding discrete variables Z. Recall that Figure 9.5(a) shows a \u2018com- plete\u2019 data set (i.e., one that includes labels showing which component generated each data point) while Figure 9.5(b) shows the corresponding \u2018incomplete\u2019 data set. The graphical model for the complete data is shown in Figure 9.9.",

From (9.10) and (9.11), this likelihood function takes the form p(X, Z|\u00b5, \u03a3, \u03c0) = N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 \u03c0znk k N(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k)znk (9.35) where znk denotes the kth component of zn. Taking the logarithm, we obtain ln p(X, Z|\u00b5, \u03a3, \u03c0) = N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 znk {ln \u03c0k + ln N(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k)} . (9.36) Comparison with the log likelihood function (9.14) for the incomplete data shows that the summation over k and the logarithm have been interchanged. The loga- rithm now acts directly on the Gaussian distribution, which itself is a member of the exponential family. Not surprisingly, this leads to a much simpler solution to the maximum likelihood problem, as we now show. Consider \ufb01rst the maximization with respect to the means and covariances. Because zn is a K-dimensional vec- tor with all elements equal to 0 except for a single element having the value 1, the complete-data log likelihood function is simply a sum of K independent contribu- tions, one for each mixture component. Thus the maximization with respect to a mean or a covariance is exactly as for a single Gaussian, except that it involves only the subset of data points that are \u2018assigned\u2019 to that component. For the maximization with respect to the mixing coef\ufb01cients, we note that these are coupled for different values of k by virtue of the summation constraint (9.9). Again, this can be enforced using a Lagrange multiplier as before, and leads to the result \u03c0k = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 znk (9.37) so that the mixing coef\ufb01cients are equal to the fractions of data points assigned to the corresponding components. Thus we see that the complete-data log likelihood function can be maximized trivially in closed form. In practice, however, we do not have values for the latent variables so, as discussed earlier, we consider the expectation, with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent variables, of the complete-data log likelihood.",

This is easily veri\ufb01ed by inspection of the directed graph in Figure 9.6 Exercise 9.5 and making use of the d-separation criterion. The expected value of the indicator Section 8.2 variable znk under this posterior distribution is then given by E[znk] = \u0002 znk znk [\u03c0kN(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k)]znk \u0002 znj \b \u03c0jN(xn|\u00b5j, \u03a3j) znj = \u03c0kN(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) K \u0002 j=1 \u03c0jN(xn|\u00b5j, \u03a3j) = \u03b3(znk) (9.39) which is just the responsibility of component k for data point xn. The expected value of the complete-data log likelihood function is therefore given by EZ[ln p(X, Z|\u00b5, \u03a3, \u03c0)] = N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 \u03b3(znk) {ln \u03c0k + ln N(xn|\u00b5k, \u03a3k)} . (9.40) We can now proceed as follows. First we choose some initial values for the param- eters \u00b5old, \u03a3old and \u03c0old, and use these to evaluate the responsibilities (the E step). We then keep the responsibilities \ufb01xed and maximize (9.40) with respect to \u00b5k, \u03a3k and \u03c0k (the M step). This leads to closed form solutions for \u00b5new, \u03a3new and \u03c0new given by (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) as before. This is precisely the EM algorithm for Exercise 9.8 Gaussian mixtures as derived earlier. We shall gain more insight into the role of the expected complete-data log likelihood function when we give a proof of convergence of the EM algorithm in Section 9.4. 9.3.2 Relation to K-means Comparison of the K-means algorithm with the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures shows that there is a close similarity. Whereas the K-means algorithm performs a hard assignment of data points to clusters, in which each data point is associated uniquely with one cluster, the EM algorithm makes a soft assignment based on the posterior probabilities. In fact, we can derive the K-means algorithm as a particular limit of EM for Gaussian mixtures as follows. Consider a Gaussian mixture model in which the covariance matrices of the mixture components are given by \u03f5I, where \u03f5 is a variance parameter that is shared",

(9.41) We now consider the EM algorithm for a mixture of K Gaussians of this form in which we treat \u03f5 as a \ufb01xed constant, instead of a parameter to be re-estimated. From (9.13) the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, for a particular data point xn, are given by \u03b3(znk) = \u03c0k exp {\u2212\u2225xn \u2212\u00b5k\u22252/2\u03f5} \u0005 j \u03c0j exp \u001a \u2212\u2225xn \u2212\u00b5j\u22252/2\u03f5\u001b. (9.42) If we consider the limit \u03f5 \u21920, we see that in the denominator the term for which \u2225xn \u2212\u00b5j\u22252 is smallest will go to zero most slowly, and hence the responsibilities \u03b3(znk) for the data point xn all go to zero except for term j, for which the responsi- bility \u03b3(znj) will go to unity. Note that this holds independently of the values of the \u03c0k so long as none of the \u03c0k is zero. Thus, in this limit, we obtain a hard assignment of data points to clusters, just as in the K-means algorithm, so that \u03b3(znk) \u2192rnk where rnk is de\ufb01ned by (9.2). Each data point is thereby assigned to the cluster having the closest mean. The EM re-estimation equation for the \u00b5k, given by (9.17), then reduces to the K-means result (9.4). Note that the re-estimation formula for the mixing coef\ufb01cients (9.22) simply re-sets the value of \u03c0k to be equal to the fraction of data points assigned to cluster k, although these parameters no longer play an active role in the algorithm. Finally, in the limit \u03f5 \u21920 the expected complete-data log likelihood, given by (9.40), becomes Exercise 9.11 EZ[ln p(X, Z|\u00b5, \u03a3, \u03c0)] \u2192\u22121 2 N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 rnk\u2225xn \u2212\u00b5k\u22252 + const. (9.43) Thus we see that in this limit, maximizing the expected complete-data log likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the distortion measure J for the K-means algorithm given by (9.1). Note that the K-means algorithm does not estimate the covariances of the clus- ters but only the cluster means. A hard-assignment version of the Gaussian mixture model with general covariance matrices, known as the elliptical K-means algorithm, has been considered by Sung and Poggio (1994). 9.3.3 Mixtures of Bernoulli distributions So far in this chapter, we have focussed on distributions over continuous vari- ables described by mixtures of Gaussians. As a further example of mixture mod- elling, and to illustrate the EM algorithm in a different context, we now discuss mix- tures of discrete binary variables described by Bernoulli distributions. This model is also known as latent class analysis (Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968; McLachlan and Peel, 2000). As well as being of practical importance in its own right, our discus- sion of Bernoulli mixtures will also lay the foundation for a consideration of hidden Markov models over discrete variables.

For the maximization with respect to \u03c0k, we need to introduce a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint \u0005 k \u03c0k = 1. Following analogous steps to those used for the mixture of Gaussians, we then obtain Exercise 9.16 \u03c0k = Nk N (9.60) which represents the intuitively reasonable result that the mixing coef\ufb01cient for com- ponent k is given by the effective fraction of points in the data set explained by that component. Note that in contrast to the mixture of Gaussians, there are no singularities in which the likelihood function goes to in\ufb01nity. This can be seen by noting that the likelihood function is bounded above because 0 \u2a7dp(xn|\u00b5k) \u2a7d1. There exist Exercise 9.17 singularities at which the likelihood function goes to zero, but these will not be found by EM provided it is not initialized to a pathological starting point, because the EM algorithm always increases the value of the likelihood function, until a local maximum is found. We illustrate the Bernoulli mixture model in Figure 9.10 by Section 9.4 using it to model handwritten digits. Here the digit images have been turned into binary vectors by setting all elements whose values exceed 0.5 to 1 and setting the remaining elements to 0.

In Section 3.5.2, we obtained the re- estimation equations for the hyperparameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 by evaluation of the evidence and then setting the derivatives of the resulting expression to zero. We now turn to an alternative approach for \ufb01nding \u03b1 and \u03b2 based on the EM algorithm. Recall that our goal is to maximize the evidence function p(t|\u03b1, \u03b2) given by (3.77) with respect to \u03b1 and \u03b2. Because the parameter vector w is marginalized out, we can regard it as a latent variable, and hence we can optimize this marginal likelihood function using EM. In the E step, we compute the posterior distribution of w given the current set- ting of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 and then use this to \ufb01nd the expected complete-data log likelihood. In the M step, we maximize this quantity with respect to \u03b1 and \u03b2. We have already derived the posterior distribution of w because this is given by (3.49). The complete-data log likelihood function is then given by ln p(t, w|\u03b1, \u03b2) = ln p(t|w, \u03b2) + ln p(w|\u03b1) (9.61)",

Exercise 9.21 Note that this re-estimation equation takes a slightly different form from the corresponding result (3.92) derived by direct evaluation of the evidence function. However, they each involve computation and inversion (or eigen decomposition) of an M \u00d7 M matrix and hence will have comparable computational cost per iteration. These two approaches to determining \u03b1 should of course converge to the same result (assuming they \ufb01nd the same local maximum of the evidence function).

(9.69) Here we are assuming Z is discrete, although the discussion is identical if Z com- prises continuous variables or a combination of discrete and continuous variables, with summation replaced by integration as appropriate. We shall suppose that direct optimization of p(X|\u03b8) is dif\ufb01cult, but that opti- mization of the complete-data likelihood function p(X, Z|\u03b8) is signi\ufb01cantly easier. Next we introduce a distribution q(Z) de\ufb01ned over the latent variables, and we ob- serve that, for any choice of q(Z), the following decomposition holds ln p(X|\u03b8) = L(q, \u03b8) + KL(q\u2225p) (9.70) where we have de\ufb01ned L(q, \u03b8) = \u0002 Z q(Z) ln p(X, Z|\u03b8) q(Z) (9.71) KL(q\u2225p) = \u2212 \u0002 Z q(Z) ln p(Z|X, \u03b8) q(Z) . (9.72) Note that L(q, \u03b8) is a functional (see Appendix D for a discussion of functionals) of the distribution q(Z), and a function of the parameters \u03b8. It is worth studying",

To verify the decomposition (9.70), we \ufb01rst make use of the product rule of probability to give Exercise 9.24 ln p(X, Z|\u03b8) = ln p(Z|X, \u03b8) + ln p(X|\u03b8) (9.73) which we then substitute into the expression for L(q, \u03b8). This gives rise to two terms, one of which cancels KL(q\u2225p) while the other gives the required log likelihood ln p(X|\u03b8) after noting that q(Z) is a normalized distribution that sums to 1. From (9.72), we see that KL(q\u2225p) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Z) and the posterior distribution p(Z|X, \u03b8). Recall that the Kullback-Leibler di- vergence satis\ufb01es KL(q\u2225p) \u2a7e0, with equality if, and only if, q(Z) = p(Z|X, \u03b8). It Section 1.6.1 therefore follows from (9.70) that L(q, \u03b8) \u2a7dln p(X|\u03b8), in other words that L(q, \u03b8) is a lower bound on ln p(X|\u03b8). The decomposition (9.70) is illustrated in Fig- ure 9.11. The EM algorithm is a two-stage iterative optimization technique for \ufb01nding maximum likelihood solutions. We can use the decomposition (9.70) to de\ufb01ne the EM algorithm and to demonstrate that it does indeed maximize the log likelihood. Suppose that the current value of the parameter vector is \u03b8old. In the E step, the lower bound L(q, \u03b8old) is maximized with respect to q(Z) while holding \u03b8old \ufb01xed. The solution to this maximization problem is easily seen by noting that the value of ln p(X|\u03b8old) does not depend on q(Z) and so the largest value of L(q, \u03b8old) will occur when the Kullback-Leibler divergence vanishes, in other words when q(Z) is equal to the posterior distribution p(Z|X, \u03b8old). In this case, the lower bound will equal the log likelihood, as illustrated in Figure 9.12. In the subsequent M step, the distribution q(Z) is held \ufb01xed and the lower bound L(q, \u03b8) is maximized with respect to \u03b8 to give some new value \u03b8new. This will cause the lower bound L to increase (unless it is already at a maximum), which will necessarily cause the corresponding log likelihood function to increase. Because the distribution q is determined using the old parameter values rather than the new values and is held \ufb01xed during the M step, it will not equal the new posterior distribution p(Z|X, \u03b8new), and hence there will be a nonzero KL divergence. The increase in the log likelihood function is therefore greater than the increase in the lower bound, as",

If we substitute q(Z) = p(Z|X, \u03b8old) into (9.71), we see that, after the E step, the lower bound takes the form L(q, \u03b8) = \u0002 Z p(Z|X, \u03b8old) ln p(X, Z|\u03b8) \u2212 \u0002 Z p(Z|X, \u03b8old) ln p(Z|X, \u03b8old) = Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) + const (9.74) where the constant is simply the negative entropy of the q distribution and is there- fore independent of \u03b8. Thus in the M step, the quantity that is being maximized is the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood, as we saw earlier in the case of mix- tures of Gaussians. Note that the variable \u03b8 over which we are optimizing appears only inside the logarithm. If the joint distribution p(Z, X|\u03b8) comprises a member of the exponential family, or a product of such members, then we see that the logarithm will cancel the exponential and lead to an M step that will be typically much simpler than the maximization of the corresponding incomplete-data log likelihood function p(X|\u03b8). The operation of the EM algorithm can also be viewed in the space of parame- ters, as illustrated schematically in Figure 9.14. Here the red curve depicts the (in- Figure 9.13 Illustration of the M step of the EM algorithm. The distribution q(Z) is held \ufb01xed and the lower bound L(q, \u03b8) is maximized with respect to the parameter vector \u03b8 to give a revised value \u03b8new. Because the KL divergence is nonnegative, this causes the log likelihood ln p(X|\u03b8) to increase by at least as much as the lower bound does. ln p(X|\u03b8new) L(q, \u03b8new) KL(q||p)",

We start with some initial parameter value \u03b8old, and in the \ufb01rst E step we evaluate the poste- rior distribution over latent variables, which gives rise to a lower bound L(\u03b8, \u03b8(old)) whose value equals the log likelihood at \u03b8(old), as shown by the blue curve. Note that the bound makes a tangential contact with the log likelihood at \u03b8(old), so that both curves have the same gradient. This bound is a convex function having a unique Exercise 9.25 maximum (for mixture components from the exponential family). In the M step, the bound is maximized giving the value \u03b8(new), which gives a larger value of log likeli- hood than \u03b8(old). The subsequent E step then constructs a bound that is tangential at \u03b8(new) as shown by the green curve. For the particular case of an independent, identically distributed data set, X will comprise N data points {xn} while Z will comprise N corresponding latent variables {zn}, where n = 1, . . . , N. From the independence assumption, we have p(X, Z) = \u0015 n p(xn, zn) and, by marginalizing over the {zn} we have p(X) = \u0015 n p(xn). Using the sum and product rules, we see that the posterior probability that is evaluated in the E step takes the form p(Z|X, \u03b8) = p(X, Z|\u03b8) \u0002 Z p(X, Z|\u03b8) = N \u000e n=1 p(xn, zn|\u03b8) \u0002 Z N \u000e n=1 p(xn, zn|\u03b8) = N \u000e n=1 p(zn|xn, \u03b8) (9.75) and so the posterior distribution also factorizes with respect to n.

MIXTURE MODELS AND EM complete EM cycle will change the model parameters in such a way as to cause the log likelihood to increase (unless it is already at a maximum, in which case the parameters remain unchanged). We can also use the EM algorithm to maximize the posterior distribution p(\u03b8|X) for models in which we have introduced a prior p(\u03b8) over the parameters. To see this, we note that as a function of \u03b8, we have p(\u03b8|X) = p(\u03b8, X)/p(X) and so ln p(\u03b8|X) = ln p(\u03b8, X) \u2212ln p(X). (9.76) Making use of the decomposition (9.70), we have ln p(\u03b8|X) = L(q, \u03b8) + KL(q\u2225p) + ln p(\u03b8) \u2212ln p(X) \u2a7e L(q, \u03b8) + ln p(\u03b8) \u2212ln p(X). (9.77) where ln p(X) is a constant. We can again optimize the right-hand side alternately with respect to q and \u03b8. The optimization with respect to q gives rise to the same E- step equations as for the standard EM algorithm, because q only appears in L(q, \u03b8). The M-step equations are modi\ufb01ed through the introduction of the prior term ln p(\u03b8), which typically requires only a small modi\ufb01cation to the standard maximum likeli- hood M-step equations. The EM algorithm breaks down the potentially dif\ufb01cult problem of maximizing the likelihood function into two stages, the E step and the M step, each of which will often prove simpler to implement. Nevertheless, for complex models it may be the case that either the E step or the M step, or indeed both, remain intractable. This leads to two possible extensions of the EM algorithm, as follows. The generalized EM, or GEM, algorithm addresses the problem of an intractable M step. Instead of aiming to maximize L(q, \u03b8) with respect to \u03b8, it seeks instead to change the parameters in such a way as to increase its value. Again, because L(q, \u03b8) is a lower bound on the log likelihood function, each complete EM cycle of the GEM algorithm is guaranteed to increase the value of the log likelihood (unless the parameters already correspond to a local maximum). One way to exploit the GEM approach would be to use one of the nonlinear optimization strategies, such as the conjugate gradients algorithm, during the M step. Another form of GEM algorithm, known as the expectation conditional maximization, or ECM, algorithm, involves making several constrained optimizations within each M step (Meng and Rubin, 1993). For instance, the parameters might be partitioned into groups, and the M step is broken down into multiple steps each of which involves optimizing one of the subset with the remainder held \ufb01xed. We can similarly generalize the E step of the EM algorithm by performing a partial, rather than complete, optimization of L(q, \u03b8) with respect to q(Z) (Neal and Hinton, 1999). As we have seen, for any given value of \u03b8 there is a unique maximum of L(q, \u03b8) with respect to q(Z) that corresponds to the posterior distribution q\u03b8(Z) = p(Z|X, \u03b8) and that for this choice of q(Z) the bound L(q, \u03b8) is equal to the log likelihood function ln p(X|\u03b8). It follows that any algorithm that converges to the global maximum of L(q, \u03b8) will \ufb01nd a value of \u03b8 that is also a global maximum of the log likelihood ln p(X|\u03b8). Provided p(X, Z|\u03b8) is a continuous function of \u03b8",

Consider the case of N independent data points x1, . . . , xN with corresponding latent variables z1, . . . , zN. The joint distribution p(X, Z|\u03b8) factorizes over the data points, and this structure can be exploited in an incremental form of EM in which at each EM cycle only one data point is processed at a time. In the E step, instead of recomputing the responsibilities for all of the data points, we just re-evaluate the responsibilities for one data point. It might appear that the subsequent M step would require computation involving the responsibilities for all of the data points. How- ever, if the mixture components are members of the exponential family, then the responsibilities enter only through simple suf\ufb01cient statistics, and these can be up- dated ef\ufb01ciently. Consider, for instance, the case of a Gaussian mixture, and suppose we perform an update for data point m in which the corresponding old and new values of the responsibilities are denoted \u03b3old(zmk) and \u03b3new(zmk). In the M step, the required suf\ufb01cient statistics can be updated incrementally. For instance, for the means the suf\ufb01cient statistics are de\ufb01ned by (9.17) and (9.18) from which we obtain Exercise 9.26 \u00b5new k = \u00b5old k + \u000f\u03b3new(zmk) \u2212\u03b3old(zmk) N new k \u0010 xm \u2212\u00b5old k (9.78) together with N new k = N old k + \u03b3new(zmk) \u2212\u03b3old(zmk). (9.79) The corresponding results for the covariances and the mixing coef\ufb01cients are analo- gous. Thus both the E step and the M step take \ufb01xed time that is independent of the total number of data points. Because the parameters are revised after each data point, rather than waiting until after the whole data set is processed, this incremental ver- sion can converge faster than the batch version. Each E or M step in this incremental algorithm is increasing the value of L(q, \u03b8) and, as we have shown above, if the algorithm converges to a local (or global) maximum of L(q, \u03b8), this will correspond to a local (or global) maximum of the log likelihood function ln p(X|\u03b8).

For many models of practical interest, it will be infeasible to evaluate the posterior distribution or indeed to compute expec- tations with respect to this distribution. This could be because the dimensionality of the latent space is too high to work with directly or because the posterior distribution has a highly complex form for which expectations are not analytically tractable.

For discrete variables, the marginal- izations involve summing over all possible con\ufb01gurations of the hidden variables, and though this is always possible in principle, we often \ufb01nd in practice that there may be exponentially many hidden states so that exact calculation is prohibitively expensive. In such situations, we need to resort to approximation schemes, and these fall broadly into two classes, according to whether they rely on stochastic or determin- istic approximations. Stochastic techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, de- scribed in Chapter 11, have enabled the widespread use of Bayesian methods across many domains. They generally have the property that given in\ufb01nite computational resource, they can generate exact results, and the approximation arises from the use of a \ufb01nite amount of processor time. In practice, sampling methods can be compu- tationally demanding, often limiting their use to small-scale problems. Also, it can be dif\ufb01cult to know whether a sampling scheme is generating independent samples from the required distribution. In this chapter, we introduce a range of deterministic approximation schemes, some of which scale well to large applications. These are based on analytical ap- proximations to the posterior distribution, for example by assuming that it factorizes in a particular way or that it has a speci\ufb01c parametric form such as a Gaussian. As such, they can never generate exact results, and so their strengths and weaknesses are complementary to those of sampling methods. In Section 4.4, we discussed the Laplace approximation, which is based on a local Gaussian approximation to a mode (i.e., a maximum) of the distribution. Here we turn to a family of approximation techniques called variational inference or vari- ational Bayes, which use more global criteria and which have been widely applied. We conclude with a brief introduction to an alternative variational framework known as expectation propagation. 10.1. Variational Inference Variational methods have their origins in the 18th century with the work of Euler, Lagrange, and others on the calculus of variations. Standard calculus is concerned with \ufb01nding derivatives of functions. We can think of a function as a mapping that takes the value of a variable as the input and returns the value of the function as the output. The derivative of the function then describes how the output value varies as we make in\ufb01nitesimal changes to the input value. Similarly, we can de\ufb01ne a functional as a mapping that takes a function as the input and that returns the value of the functional as the output. An example would be the entropy H[p], which takes a probability distribution p(x) as the input and returns the quantity H[p] = \u0006 p(x) ln p(x) dx (10.1)",

We can the introduce the concept of a functional derivative, which ex- presses how the value of the functional changes in response to in\ufb01nitesimal changes to the input function (Feynman et al., 1964). The rules for the calculus of variations mirror those of standard calculus and are discussed in Appendix D. Many problems can be expressed in terms of an optimization problem in which the quantity being optimized is a functional. The solution is obtained by exploring all possible input functions to \ufb01nd the one that maximizes, or minimizes, the functional. Variational methods have broad applicability and include such areas as \ufb01nite element methods (Kapur, 1989) and maximum entropy (Schwarz, 1988). Although there is nothing intrinsically approximate about variational methods, they do naturally lend themselves to \ufb01nding approximate solutions. This is done by restricting the range of functions over which the optimization is performed, for instance by considering only quadratic functions or by considering functions com- posed of a linear combination of \ufb01xed basis functions in which only the coef\ufb01cients of the linear combination can vary. In the case of applications to probabilistic in- ference, the restriction may for example take the form of factorization assumptions (Jordan et al., 1999; Jaakkola, 2001). Now let us consider in more detail how the concept of variational optimization can be applied to the inference problem. Suppose we have a fully Bayesian model in which all parameters are given prior distributions. The model may also have latent variables as well as parameters, and we shall denote the set of all latent variables and parameters by Z. Similarly, we denote the set of all observed variables by X. For example, we might have a set of N independent, identically distributed data, for which X = {x1, . . . , xN} and Z = {z1, . . . , zN}. Our probabilistic model speci\ufb01es the joint distribution p(X, Z), and our goal is to \ufb01nd an approximation for the posterior distribution p(Z|X) as well as for the model evidence p(X). As in our discussion of EM, we can decompose the log marginal probability using ln p(X) = L(q) + KL(q\u2225p) (10.2) where we have de\ufb01ned L(q) = \u0006 q(Z) ln p(X, Z) q(Z) dZ (10.3) KL(q\u2225p) = \u2212 \u0006 q(Z) ln p(Z|X) q(Z) dZ. (10.4) This differs from our discussion of EM only in that the parameter vector \u03b8 no longer appears, because the parameters are now stochastic variables and are absorbed into Z. Since in this chapter we will mainly be interested in continuous variables we have used integrations rather than summations in formulating this decomposition. How- ever, the analysis goes through unchanged if some or all of the variables are discrete simply by replacing the integrations with summations as required. As before, we can maximize the lower bound L(q) by optimization with respect to the distribution q(Z), which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence. If we allow any possible choice for q(Z), then the maximum of the lower bound occurs when the KL diver- gence vanishes, which occurs when q(Z) equals the posterior distribution p(Z|X).",

However, we shall suppose the model is such that working with the true posterior distribution is intractable. We therefore consider instead a restricted family of distributions q(Z) and then seek the member of this family for which the KL divergence is minimized. Our goal is to restrict the family suf\ufb01ciently that they comprise only tractable distributions, while at the same time allowing the family to be suf\ufb01ciently rich and \ufb02exible that it can provide a good approximation to the true posterior distribution. It is important to emphasize that the restriction is imposed purely to achieve tractability, and that sub- ject to this requirement we should use as rich a family of approximating distributions as possible. In particular, there is no \u2018over-\ufb01tting\u2019 associated with highly \ufb02exible dis- tributions. Using more \ufb02exible approximations simply allows us to approach the true posterior distribution more closely. One way to restrict the family of approximating distributions is to use a paramet- ric distribution q(Z|\u03c9) governed by a set of parameters \u03c9. The lower bound L(q) then becomes a function of \u03c9, and we can exploit standard nonlinear optimization techniques to determine the optimal values for the parameters. An example of this approach, in which the variational distribution is a Gaussian and we have optimized with respect to its mean and variance, is shown in Figure 10.1. 10.1.1 Factorized distributions Here we consider an alternative way in which to restrict the family of distri- butions q(Z). Suppose we partition the elements of Z into disjoint groups that we denote by Zi where i = 1, . . . , M. We then assume that the q distribution factorizes with respect to these groups, so that q(Z) = M \u000e i=1 qi(Zi). (10.5)",

Amongst all distributions q(Z) having the form (10.5), we now seek that distri- bution for which the lower bound L(q) is largest. We therefore wish to make a free form (variational) optimization of L(q) with respect to all of the distributions qi(Zi), which we do by optimizing with respect to each of the factors in turn. To achieve this, we \ufb01rst substitute (10.5) into (10.3) and then dissect out the dependence on one of the factors qj(Zj). Denoting qj(Zj) by simply qj to keep the notation uncluttered, we then obtain L(q) = \u0006 \u000e i qi \u0018 ln p(X, Z) \u2212 \u0002 i ln qi \u0019 dZ = \u0006 qj \u0018\u0006 ln p(X, Z) \u000e i\u0338=j qi dZi \u0019 dZj \u2212 \u0006 qj ln qj dZj + const = \u0006 qj ln\u0004p(X, Zj) dZj \u2212 \u0006 qj ln qj dZj + const (10.6) where we have de\ufb01ned a new distribution \u0004p(X, Zj) by the relation ln\u0004p(X, Zj) = Ei\u0338=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const. (10.7) Here the notation Ei\u0338=j[\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] denotes an expectation with respect to the q distributions over all variables zi for i \u0338= j, so that Ei\u0338=j[ln p(X, Z)] = \u0006 ln p(X, Z) \u000e i\u0338=j qi dZi.

Thus we obtain a general expression for the optimal solution q\u22c6 j (Zj) given by ln q\u22c6 j (Zj) = Ei\u0338=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const. (10.9) It is worth taking a few moments to study the form of this solution as it provides the basis for applications of variational methods. It says that the log of the optimal so- lution for factor qj is obtained simply by considering the log of the joint distribution over all hidden and visible variables and then taking the expectation with respect to all of the other factors {qi} for i \u0338= j. The additive constant in (10.9) is set by normalizing the distribution q\u22c6 j (Zj). Thus if we take the exponential of both sides and normalize, we have q\u22c6 j (Zj) = exp (Ei\u0338=j[ln p(X, Z)]) \u0006 exp (Ei\u0338=j[ln p(X, Z)]) dZj . In practice, we shall \ufb01nd it more convenient to work with the form (10.9) and then re- instate the normalization constant (where required) by inspection. This will become clear from subsequent examples. The set of equations given by (10.9) for j = 1, . . . , M represent a set of con- sistency conditions for the maximum of the lower bound subject to the factorization constraint. However, they do not represent an explicit solution because the expres- sion on the right-hand side of (10.9) for the optimum q\u22c6 j (Zj) depends on expectations computed with respect to the other factors qi(Zi) for i \u0338= j. We will therefore seek a consistent solution by \ufb01rst initializing all of the factors qi(Zi) appropriately and then cycling through the factors and replacing each in turn with a revised estimate given by the right-hand side of (10.9) evaluated using the current estimates for all of the other factors. Convergence is guaranteed because bound is convex with respect to each of the factors qi(Zi) (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). 10.1.2 Properties of factorized approximations Our approach to variational inference is based on a factorized approximation to the true posterior distribution. Let us consider for a moment the problem of approx- imating a general distribution by a factorized distribution. To begin with, we discuss the problem of approximating a Gaussian distribution using a factorized Gaussian, which will provide useful insight into the types of inaccuracy introduced in using factorized approximations. Consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) = N(z|\u00b5, \u039b\u22121) over two correlated variables z = (z1, z2) in which the mean and precision have elements \u00b5 = \u000f \u00b51 \u00b52 \u0010 , \u039b = \u000f \u039b11 \u039b12 \u039b21 \u039b22 \u0010 (10.10) and \u039b21 = \u039b12 due to the symmetry of the precision matrix. Now suppose we wish to approximate this distribution using a factorized Gaussian of the form q(z) = q1(z1)q2(z2). We \ufb01rst apply the general result (10.9) to \ufb01nd an expression for the",

In doing so it is useful to note that on the right-hand side we only need to retain those terms that have some functional dependence on z1 because all other terms can be absorbed into the normalization constant. Thus we have ln q\u22c6 1(z1) = Ez2[ln p(z)] + const = Ez2 \u22121 2(z1 \u2212\u00b51)2\u039b11 \u2212(z1 \u2212\u00b51)\u039b12(z2 \u2212\u00b52) + const = \u22121 2z2 1\u039b11 + z1\u00b51\u039b11 \u2212z1\u039b12 (E[z2] \u2212\u00b52) + const. (10.11) Next we observe that the right-hand side of this expression is a quadratic function of z1, and so we can identify q\u22c6(z1) as a Gaussian distribution. It is worth emphasizing that we did not assume that q(zi) is Gaussian, but rather we derived this result by variational optimization of the KL divergence over all possible distributions q(zi). Note also that we do not need to consider the additive constant in (10.9) explicitly because it represents the normalization constant that can be found at the end by inspection if required. Using the technique of completing the square, we can identify Section 2.3.1 the mean and precision of this Gaussian, giving q\u22c6(z1) = N(z1|m1, \u039b\u22121 11 ) (10.12) where m1 = \u00b51 \u2212\u039b\u22121 11 \u039b12 (E[z2] \u2212\u00b52) . (10.13) By symmetry, q\u22c6 2(z2) is also Gaussian and can be written as q\u22c6 2(z2) = N(z2|m2, \u039b\u22121 22 ) (10.14) in which m2 = \u00b52 \u2212\u039b\u22121 22 \u039b21 (E[z1] \u2212\u00b51) . (10.15) Note that these solutions are coupled, so that q\u22c6(z1) depends on expectations com- puted with respect to q\u22c6(z2) and vice versa. In general, we address this by treating the variational solutions as re-estimation equations and cycling through the variables in turn updating them until some convergence criterion is satis\ufb01ed. We shall see an example of this shortly. Here, however, we note that the problem is suf\ufb01ciently simple that a closed form solution can be found. In particular, because E[z1] = m1 and E[z2] = m2, we see that the two equations are satis\ufb01ed if we take E[z1] = \u00b51 and E[z2] = \u00b52, and it is easily shown that this is the only solution provided the dis- tribution is nonsingular. This result is illustrated in Figure 10.2(a). We see that the Exercise 10.2 mean is correctly captured but that the variance of q(z) is controlled by the direction of smallest variance of p(z), and that the variance along the orthogonal direction is signi\ufb01cantly under-estimated. It is a general result that a factorized variational ap- proximation tends to give approximations to the posterior distribution that are too compact. By way of comparison, suppose instead that we had been minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(p\u2225q). As we shall see, this form of KL divergence",

We therefore consider the general problem of minimizing KL(p\u2225q) when Section 10.7 q(Z) is a factorized approximation of the form (10.5). The KL divergence can then be written in the form KL(p\u2225q) = \u2212 \u0006 p(Z) M \u0002 i=1 ln qi(Zi) dZ + const (10.16) where the constant term is simply the entropy of p(Z) and so does not depend on q(Z).

Note that this is a closed-form solution and so does not require iteration. To apply this result to the illustrative example of a Gaussian distribution p(z) over a vector z we can use (2.98), which gives the result shown in Figure 10.2(b). We see that once again the mean of the approximation is correct, but that it places signi\ufb01cant probability mass in regions of variable space that have very low probabil- ity. The difference between these two results can be understood by noting that there is a large positive contribution to the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(q\u2225p) = \u2212 \u0006 q(Z) ln p(Z) q(Z) dZ (10.18)",

Conversely, the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(p\u2225q) is minimized by distributions q(Z) that are nonzero in regions where p(Z) is nonzero. We can gain further insight into the different behaviour of the two KL diver- gences if we consider approximating a multimodal distribution by a unimodal one, as illustrated in Figure 10.3. In practical applications, the true posterior distri- bution will often be multimodal, with most of the posterior mass concentrated in some number of relatively small regions of parameter space. These multiple modes may arise through nonidenti\ufb01ability in the latent space or through complex nonlin- ear dependence on the parameters. Both types of multimodality were encountered in Chapter 9 in the context of Gaussian mixtures, where they manifested themselves as multiple maxima in the likelihood function, and a variational treatment based on the minimization of KL(q\u2225p) will tend to \ufb01nd one of these modes. By contrast, if we were to minimize KL(p\u2225q), the resulting approximations would average across all of the modes and, in the context of the mixture model, would lead to poor predictive distributions (because the average of two good parameter values is typically itself not a good parameter value). It is possible to make use of KL(p\u2225q) to de\ufb01ne a useful inference procedure, but this requires a rather different approach to the one discussed here, and will be considered in detail when we discuss expectation propagation.

For q\u00b5(\u00b5) we have ln q\u22c6 \u00b5(\u00b5) = E\u03c4 [ln p(D|\u00b5, \u03c4) + ln p(\u00b5|\u03c4)] + const = \u2212E[\u03c4] 2 \u0018 \u03bb0(\u00b5 \u2212\u00b50)2 + N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5)2 \u0019 + const. (10.25) Completing the square over \u00b5 we see that q\u00b5(\u00b5) is a Gaussian N \u00b5|\u00b5N, \u03bb\u22121 N with mean and precision given by Exercise 10.7 \u00b5N = \u03bb0\u00b50 + Nx \u03bb0 + N (10.26) \u03bbN = (\u03bb0 + N)E[\u03c4]. (10.27) Note that for N \u2192\u221ethis gives the maximum likelihood result in which \u00b5N = x and the precision is in\ufb01nite. Similarly, the optimal solution for the factor q\u03c4(\u03c4) is given by ln q\u22c6 \u03c4(\u03c4) = E\u00b5 [ln p(D|\u00b5, \u03c4) + ln p(\u00b5|\u03c4)] + ln p(\u03c4) + const = (a0 \u22121) ln \u03c4 \u2212b0\u03c4 + N 2 ln \u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 2E\u00b5 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5)2 + \u03bb0(\u00b5 \u2212\u00b50)2 + const (10.28) and hence q\u03c4(\u03c4) is a gamma distribution Gam(\u03c4|aN, bN) with parameters aN = a0 + N 2 (10.29) bN = b0 + 1 2E\u00b5 N \u0002 n=1 (xn \u2212\u00b5)2 + \u03bb0(\u00b5 \u2212\u00b50)2 . (10.30) Again this exhibits the expected behaviour when N \u2192\u221e. Exercise 10.8 It should be emphasized that we did not assume these speci\ufb01c functional forms for the optimal distributions q\u00b5(\u00b5) and q\u03c4(\u03c4). They arose naturally from the structure of the likelihood function and the corresponding conjugate priors. Section 10.4.1 Thus we have expressions for the optimal distributions q\u00b5(\u00b5) and q\u03c4(\u03c4) each of which depends on moments evaluated with respect to the other distribution. One ap- proach to \ufb01nding a solution is therefore to make an initial guess for, say, the moment E[\u03c4] and use this to re-compute the distribution q\u00b5(\u00b5). Given this revised distri- bution we can then extract the required moments E[\u00b5] and E[\u00b52], and use these to recompute the distribution q\u03c4(\u03c4), and so on. Since the space of hidden variables for this example is only two dimensional, we can illustrate the variational approxima- tion to the posterior distribution by plotting contours of both the true posterior and the factorized approximation, as illustrated in Figure 10.4.",

Although these parameter settings correspond to improper priors, we see that the posterior distribution is still well de\ufb01ned.

(10.33) We recognize the right-hand side as the familiar unbiased estimator for the variance of a univariate Gaussian distribution, and so we see that the use of a Bayesian ap- proach has avoided the bias of the maximum likelihood solution. Section 1.2.4 10.1.4 Model comparison As well as performing inference over the hidden variables Z, we may also wish to compare a set of candidate models, labelled by the index m, and having prior probabilities p(m). Our goal is then to approximate the posterior probabilities p(m|X), where X is the observed data. This is a slightly more complex situation than that considered so far because different models may have different structure and indeed different dimensionality for the hidden variables Z. We cannot there- fore simply consider a factorized approximation q(Z)q(m), but must instead recog- nize that the posterior over Z must be conditioned on m, and so we must consider q(Z, m) = q(Z|m)q(m). We can readily verify the following decomposition based on this variational distribution Exercise 10.10 ln p(X) = Lm \u2212 \u0002 m \u0002 Z q(Z|m)q(m) ln p(Z, m|X) q(Z|m)q(m) (10.34) where the Lm is a lower bound on ln p(X) and is given by Lm = \u0002 m \u0002 Z q(Z|m)q(m) ln p(Z, X, m) q(Z|m)q(m) . (10.35) Here we are assuming discrete Z, but the same analysis applies to continuous latent variables provided the summations are replaced with integrations. We can maximize Lm with respect to the distribution q(m) using a Lagrange multiplier, with the result Exercise 10.11 q(m) \u221dp(m) exp{Lm}. (10.36) However, if we maximize Lm with respect to the q(Z|m), we \ufb01nd that the solutions for different m are coupled, as we expect because they are conditioned on m. We proceed instead by \ufb01rst optimizing each of the q(Z|m) individually by optimization",

Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians We now return to our discussion of the Gaussian mixture model and apply the vari- ational inference machinery developed in the previous section. This will provide a good illustration of the application of variational methods and will also demonstrate how a Bayesian treatment elegantly resolves many of the dif\ufb01culties associated with the maximum likelihood approach (Attias, 1999b). The reader is encouraged to work through this example in detail as it provides many insights into the practical appli- cation of variational methods. Many Bayesian models, corresponding to much more sophisticated distributions, can be solved by straightforward extensions and general- izations of this analysis. Our starting point is the likelihood function for the Gaussian mixture model, il- lustrated by the graphical model in Figure 9.6. For each observation xn we have a corresponding latent variable zn comprising a 1-of-K binary vector with ele- ments znk for k = 1, . . . , K. As before we denote the observed data set by X = {x1, . . . , xN}, and similarly we denote the latent variables by Z = {z1, . . . , zN}. From (9.10) we can write down the conditional distribution of Z, given the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0, in the form p(Z|\u03c0) = N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 \u03c0znk k . (10.37) Similarly, from (9.11), we can write down the conditional distribution of the ob- served data vectors, given the latent variables and the component parameters p(X|Z, \u00b5, \u039b) = N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 N xn|\u00b5k, \u039b\u22121 k znk (10.38) where \u00b5 = {\u00b5k} and \u039b = {\u039bk}. Note that we are working in terms of precision matrices rather than covariance matrices as this somewhat simpli\ufb01es the mathemat- ics. Next we introduce priors over the parameters \u00b5, \u039b and \u03c0. The analysis is con- siderably simpli\ufb01ed if we use conjugate prior distributions. We therefore choose a Section 10.4.1 Dirichlet distribution over the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0 p(\u03c0) = Dir(\u03c0|\u03b10) = C(\u03b10) K \u000e k=1 \u03c0\u03b10\u22121 k (10.39) where by symmetry we have chosen the same parameter \u03b10 for each of the compo- nents, and C(\u03b10) is the normalization constant for the Dirichlet distribution de\ufb01ned",

As we have seen, the parameter \u03b10 can be interpreted as the effective Section 2.2.1 prior number of observations associated with each component of the mixture. If the value of \u03b10 is small, then the posterior distribution will be in\ufb02uenced primarily by the data rather than by the prior. Similarly, we introduce an independent Gaussian-Wishart prior governing the mean and precision of each Gaussian component, given by p(\u00b5, \u039b) = p(\u00b5|\u039b)p(\u039b) = K \u000e k=1 N \u00b5k|m0, (\u03b20\u039bk)\u22121 W(\u039bk|W0, \u03bd0) (10.40) because this represents the conjugate prior distribution when both the mean and pre- cision are unknown. Typically we would choose m0 = 0 by symmetry. Section 2.3.6 The resulting model can be represented as a directed graph as shown in Fig- ure 10.5. Note that there is a link from \u039b to \u00b5 since the variance of the distribution over \u00b5 in (10.40) is a function of \u039b. This example provides a nice illustration of the distinction between latent vari- ables and parameters. Variables such as zn that appear inside the plate are regarded as latent variables because the number of such variables grows with the size of the data set. By contrast, variables such as \u00b5 that are outside the plate are \ufb01xed in number independently of the size of the data set, and so are regarded as parameters. From the perspective of graphical models, however, there is really no fundamental difference between them. 10.2.1 Variational distribution In order to formulate a variational treatment of this model, we next write down the joint distribution of all of the random variables, which is given by p(X, Z, \u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) = p(X|Z, \u00b5, \u039b)p(Z|\u03c0)p(\u03c0)p(\u00b5|\u039b)p(\u039b) (10.41) in which the various factors are de\ufb01ned above. The reader should take a moment to verify that this decomposition does indeed correspond to the probabilistic graphical model shown in Figure 10.5. Note that only the variables X = {x1, . . . , xN} are observed.",

    "text": "476 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE We now consider a variational distribution which factorizes between the latent variables and the parameters so that q(Z, \u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) = q(Z)q(\u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b). (10.42) It is remarkable that this is the only assumption that we need to make in order to obtain a tractable practical solution to our Bayesian mixture model. In particular, the functional form of the factors q(Z) and q(\u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) will be determined automatically by optimization of the variational distribution. Note that we are omitting the sub- scripts on the q distributions, much as we do with the p distributions in (10.41), and are relying on the arguments to distinguish the different distributions. The corresponding sequential update equations for these factors can be easily derived by making use of the general result (10.9). Let us consider the derivation of the update equation for the factor q(Z). The log of the optimized factor is given by ln q\u22c6(Z) = E\u03c0,\u00b5,\u039b[ln p(X, Z, \u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b)] + const. (10.43) We now make use of the decomposition (10.41). Note that we are only interested in the functional dependence of the right-hand side on the variable Z. Thus any terms that do not depend on Z can be absorbed into the additive normalization constant, giving ln q\u22c6(Z) = E\u03c0[ln p(Z|\u03c0)] + E\u00b5,\u039b[ln p(X|Z, \u00b5, \u039b)] + const. (10.44) Substituting for the two conditional distributions on the right-hand side, and again absorbing any terms that are independent of Z into the additive constant, we have ln q\u22c6(Z) = N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 znk ln \u03c1nk + const (10.45) where we have de\ufb01ned ln \u03c1nk = E[ln \u03c0k] + 1 2E [ln |\u039bk| ] \u2212D 2 ln(2\u03c0) \u22121 2E\u00b5k,\u039bk \b (xn \u2212\u00b5k)T\u039bk(xn \u2212\u00b5k) (10.46) where D is the dimensionality of the data variable x. Taking the exponential of both sides of (10.45) we obtain q\u22c6(Z) \u221d N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 \u03c1znk nk . (10.47) Requiring that this distribution be normalized, and noting that for each value of n the quantities znk are binary and sum to 1 over all values of k, we obtain Exercise 10.12 q\u22c6(Z) = N \u000e n=1 K \u000e k=1 rznk nk (10.48)",

(10.49) We see that the optimal solution for the factor q(Z) takes the same functional form as the prior p(Z|\u03c0). Note that because \u03c1nk is given by the exponential of a real quantity, the quantities rnk will be nonnegative and will sum to one, as required. For the discrete distribution q\u22c6(Z) we have the standard result E[znk] = rnk (10.50) from which we see that the quantities rnk are playing the role of responsibilities. Note that the optimal solution for q\u22c6(Z) depends on moments evaluated with respect to the distributions of other variables, and so again the variational update equations are coupled and must be solved iteratively. At this point, we shall \ufb01nd it convenient to de\ufb01ne three statistics of the observed data set evaluated with respect to the responsibilities, given by Nk = N \u0002 n=1 rnk (10.51) xk = 1 Nk N \u0002 n=1 rnkxn (10.52) Sk = 1 Nk N \u0002 n=1 rnk(xn \u2212xk)(xn \u2212xk)T. (10.53) Note that these are analogous to quantities evaluated in the maximum likelihood EM algorithm for the Gaussian mixture model. Now let us consider the factor q(\u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) in the variational posterior distribu- tion. Again using the general result (10.9) we have ln q\u22c6(\u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) = ln p(\u03c0) + K \u0002 k=1 ln p(\u00b5k, \u039bk) + EZ [ln p(Z|\u03c0)] + K \u0002 k=1 N \u0002 n=1 E[znk] ln N xn|\u00b5k, \u039b\u22121 k + const. (10.54) We observe that the right-hand side of this expression decomposes into a sum of terms involving only \u03c0 together with terms only involving \u00b5 and \u039b, which implies that the variational posterior q(\u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) factorizes to give q(\u03c0)q(\u00b5, \u039b). Further- more, the terms involving \u00b5 and \u039b themselves comprise a sum over k of terms involving \u00b5k and \u039bk leading to the further factorization q(\u03c0, \u00b5, \u039b) = q(\u03c0) K \u000e k=1 q(\u00b5k, \u039bk).

Taking the exponential of both sides, we recognize q\u22c6(\u03c0) as a Dirichlet distribution q\u22c6(\u03c0) = Dir(\u03c0|\u03b1) (10.57) where \u03b1 has components \u03b1k given by \u03b1k = \u03b10 + Nk. (10.58) Finally, the variational posterior distribution q\u22c6(\u00b5k, \u039bk) does not factorize into the product of the marginals, but we can always use the product rule to write it in the form q\u22c6(\u00b5k, \u039bk) = q\u22c6(\u00b5k|\u039bk)q\u22c6(\u039bk). The two factors can be found by inspecting (10.54) and reading off those terms that involve \u00b5k and \u039bk. The result, as expected, is a Gaussian-Wishart distribution and is given by Exercise 10.13 q\u22c6(\u00b5k, \u039bk) = N \u00b5k|mk, (\u03b2k\u039bk)\u22121 W(\u039bk|Wk, \u03bdk) (10.59) where we have de\ufb01ned \u03b2k = \u03b20 + Nk (10.60) mk = 1 \u03b2k (\u03b20m0 + Nkxk) (10.61) W\u22121 k = W\u22121 0 + NkSk + \u03b20Nk \u03b20 + Nk (xk \u2212m0)(xk \u2212m0)T (10.62) \u03bdk = \u03bd0 + Nk. (10.63) These update equations are analogous to the M-step equations of the EM algorithm for the maximum likelihood solution of the mixture of Gaussians. We see that the computations that must be performed in order to update the variational posterior distribution over the model parameters involve evaluation of the same sums over the data set, as arose in the maximum likelihood treatment. In order to perform this variational M step, we need the expectations E[znk] = rnk representing the responsibilities. These are obtained by normalizing the \u03c1nk that are given by (10.46). We see that this expression involves expectations with respect to the variational distributions of the parameters, and these are easily evaluated to give Exercise 10.14 E\u00b5k,\u039bk \b (xn \u2212\u00b5k)T\u039bk(xn \u2212\u00b5k) = D\u03b2\u22121 k + \u03bdk(xn \u2212mk)TWk(xn \u2212mk) (10.64) ln \u0004\u039bk \u2261E [ln |\u039bk| ] = D \u0002 i=1 \u03c8 \u000f\u03bdk + 1 \u2212i 2 \u0010 + D ln 2 + ln |Wk| (10.65) ln \u0004\u03c0k \u2261E [ln \u03c0k] = \u03c8(\u03b1k) \u2212\u03c8(\u0001\u03b1) (10.66)",

Thus the optimization of the variational posterior distribution involves cycling between two stages analogous to the E and M steps of the maximum likelihood EM algorithm. In the variational equivalent of the E step, we use the current distributions over the model parameters to evaluate the moments in (10.64), (10.65), and (10.66) and hence evaluate E[znk] = rnk. Then in the subsequent variational equivalent of the M step, we keep these responsibilities \ufb01xed and use them to re-compute the variational distribution over the parameters using (10.57) and (10.59). In each case, we see that the variational posterior distribution has the same functional form as the corresponding factor in the joint distribution (10.41). This is a general result and is a consequence of the choice of conjugate distributions. Section 10.4.1 Figure 10.6 shows the results of applying this approach to the rescaled Old Faith- ful data set for a Gaussian mixture model having K = 6 components. We see that after convergence, there are only two components for which the expected values of the mixing coef\ufb01cients are numerically distinguishable from their prior values. This effect can be understood qualitatively in terms of the automatic trade-off in a Bayesian model between \ufb01tting the data and the complexity of the model, in which Section 3.4 the complexity penalty arises from components whose parameters are pushed away from their prior values. Components that take essentially no responsibility for ex- plaining the data points have rnk \u22430 and hence Nk \u22430. From (10.58), we see that \u03b1k \u2243\u03b10 and from (10.60)\u2013(10.63) we see that the other parameters revert to their prior values.

In Figure 10.6, the prior over the mixing coef\ufb01cients is a Dirichlet of the form (10.39). Recall from Figure 2.5 that for \u03b10 < 1 the prior favours solutions in which some of the mixing coef\ufb01cients are zero. Figure 10.6 was obtained using \u03b10 = 10\u22123, and resulted in two components having nonzero mixing coef\ufb01cients. If instead we choose \u03b10 = 1 we obtain three components with nonzero mixing coef\ufb01cients, and for \u03b1 = 10 all six components have nonzero mixing coef\ufb01cients. As we have seen there is a close similarity between the variational solution for the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians and the EM algorithm for maximum likelihood. In fact if we consider the limit N \u2192\u221ethen the Bayesian treatment converges to the maximum likelihood EM algorithm. For anything other than very small data sets, the dominant computational cost of the variational algorithm for Gaussian mixtures arises from the evaluation of the responsibilities, together with the evaluation and inversion of the weighted data covariance matrices. These computations mirror pre- cisely those that arise in the maximum likelihood EM algorithm, and so there is little computational overhead in using this Bayesian approach as compared to the tradi- tional maximum likelihood one. There are, however, some substantial advantages. First of all, the singularities that arise in maximum likelihood when a Gaussian com- ponent \u2018collapses\u2019 onto a speci\ufb01c data point are absent in the Bayesian treatment.",

Furthermore, there is no over-\ufb01tting if we choose a large number K of components in the mixture, as we saw in Fig- ure 10.6. Finally, the variational treatment opens up the possibility of determining the optimal number of components in the mixture without resorting to techniques such as cross validation. Section 10.2.4 10.2.2 Variational lower bound We can also straightforwardly evaluate the lower bound (10.3) for this model. In practice, it is useful to be able to monitor the bound during the re-estimation in order to test for convergence. It can also provide a valuable check on both the math- ematical expressions for the solutions and their software implementation, because at each step of the iterative re-estimation procedure the value of this bound should not decrease. We can take this a stage further to provide a deeper test of the correctness of both the mathematical derivation of the update equations and of their software im- plementation by using \ufb01nite differences to check that each update does indeed give a (constrained) maximum of the bound (Svens\u00b4en and Bishop, 2004).

Some simpli\ufb01cations and combination of terms can be performed when these expressions are summed to give the lower bound. However, we have kept the expressions sepa- rate for ease of understanding. Finally, it is worth noting that the lower bound provides an alternative approach for deriving the variational re-estimation equations obtained in Section 10.2.1. To do this we use the fact that, since the model has conjugate priors, the functional form of the factors in the variational posterior distribution is known, namely discrete for Z, Dirichlet for \u03c0, and Gaussian-Wishart for (\u00b5k, \u039bk). By taking general parametric forms for these distributions we can derive the form of the lower bound as a function of the parameters of the distributions. Maximizing the bound with respect to these parameters then gives the required re-estimation equations.

When the size N of the data set is large the predictive distribution (10.81) reduces to a mixture of Gaussians. Exercise 10.20 10.2.4 Determining the number of components We have seen that the variational lower bound can be used to determine a pos- terior distribution over the number K of components in the mixture model. There Section 10.1.4 is, however, one subtlety that needs to be addressed. For any given setting of the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model (except for speci\ufb01c degenerate settings), there will exist other parameter settings for which the density over the observed vari- ables will be identical. These parameter values differ only through a re-labelling of the components. For instance, consider a mixture of two Gaussians and a single ob- served variable x, in which the parameters have the values \u03c01 = a, \u03c02 = b, \u00b51 = c, \u00b52 = d, \u03c31 = e, \u03c32 = f. Then the parameter values \u03c01 = b, \u03c02 = a, \u00b51 = d, \u00b52 = c, \u03c31 = f, \u03c32 = e, in which the two components have been exchanged, will by symmetry give rise to the same value of p(x). If we have a mixture model com- prising K components, then each parameter setting will be a member of a family of K! equivalent settings. Exercise 10.21 In the context of maximum likelihood, this redundancy is irrelevant because the parameter optimization algorithm (for example EM) will, depending on the initial- ization of the parameters, \ufb01nd one speci\ufb01c solution, and the other equivalent solu- tions play no role. In a Bayesian setting, however, we marginalize over all possible",

We have seen in Figure 10.2 that if the true posterior distribution is multimodal, variational inference based on the minimization of KL(q\u2225p) will tend to approximate the distribution in the neighbourhood of one of the modes and ignore the others. Again, because equivalent modes have equivalent predictive densities, this is of no concern provided we are considering a model having a speci\ufb01c number K of components. If, however, we wish to compare different values of K, then we need to take account of this multimodality. A simple approximate solution is to add a term ln K! onto the lower bound when used for model comparison and averaging. Exercise 10.22 Figure 10.7 shows a plot of the lower bound, including the multimodality fac- tor, versus the number K of components for the Old Faithful data set. It is worth emphasizing once again that maximum likelihood would lead to values of the likeli- hood function that increase monotonically with K (assuming the singular solutions have been avoided, and discounting the effects of local maxima) and so cannot be used to determine an appropriate model complexity. By contrast, Bayesian inference automatically makes the trade-off between model complexity and \ufb01tting the data. Section 3.4 This approach to the determination of K requires that a range of models having different K values be trained and compared. An alternative approach to determining a suitable value for K is to treat the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0 as parameters and make point estimates of their values by maximizing the lower bound (Corduneanu and Bishop, 2001) with respect to \u03c0 instead of maintaining a probability distribution over them as in the fully Bayesian approach. This leads to the re-estimation equation Exercise 10.23 \u03c0k = 1 N N \u0002 n=1 rnk (10.83) and this maximization is interleaved with the variational updates for the q distribution over the remaining parameters.

This allows us to make a single training run in which we start with a relatively large initial value of K, and allow surplus components to be pruned out of the model. The origins of the sparsity when optimizing with respect to hyperparameters is discussed in detail in the context of the relevance vector machine. Section 7.2.2 10.2.5 Induced factorizations In deriving these variational update equations for the Gaussian mixture model, we assumed a particular factorization of the variational posterior distribution given by (10.42). However, the optimal solutions for the various factors exhibit additional factorizations. In particular, the solution for q\u22c6(\u00b5, \u039b) is given by the product of an independent distribution q\u22c6(\u00b5k, \u039bk) over each of the components k of the mixture, whereas the variational posterior distribution q\u22c6(Z) over the latent variables, given by (10.48), factorizes into an independent distribution q\u22c6(zn) for each observation n (note that it does not further factorize with respect to k because, for each value of n, the znk are constrained to sum to one over k). These additional factorizations are a consequence of the interaction between the assumed factorization and the conditional independence properties of the true distribution, as characterized by the directed graph in Figure 10.5. We shall refer to these additional factorizations as induced factorizations be- cause they arise from an interaction between the factorization assumed in the varia- tional posterior distribution and the conditional independence properties of the true joint distribution. In a numerical implementation of the variational approach it is important to take account of such additional factorizations. For instance, it would be very inef\ufb01cient to maintain a full precision matrix for the Gaussian distribution over a set of variables if the optimal form for that distribution always had a diago- nal precision matrix (corresponding to a factorization with respect to the individual variables described by that Gaussian). Such induced factorizations can easily be detected using a simple graphical test based on d-separation as follows. We partition the latent variables into three disjoint groups A, B, C and then let us suppose that we are assuming a factorization between C and the remaining latent variables, so that q(A, B, C) = q(A, B)q(C). (10.84) Using the general result (10.9), together with the product rule for probabilities, we see that the optimal solution for q(A, B) is given by ln q\u22c6(A, B) = EC[ln p(X, A, B, C)] + const = EC[ln p(A, B|X, C)] + const. (10.85) We now ask whether this resulting solution will factorize between A and B, in other words whether q\u22c6(A, B) = q\u22c6(A)q\u22c6(B). This will happen if, and only if, ln p(A, B|X, C) = ln p(A|X, C) + ln p(B|X, C), that is, if the conditional inde- pendence relation A \u22a5\u22a5B | X, C (10.86)",

To illustrate this, consider again the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians represented by the directed graph in Figure 10.5, in which we are assuming a variational fac- torization given by (10.42). We can see immediately that the variational posterior distribution over the parameters must factorize between \u03c0 and the remaining param- eters \u00b5 and \u039b because all paths connecting \u03c0 to either \u00b5 or \u039b must pass through one of the nodes zn all of which are in the conditioning set for our conditional inde- pendence test and all of which are head-to-tail with respect to such paths. 10.3. Variational Linear Regression As a second illustration of variational inference, we return to the Bayesian linear regression model of Section 3.3. In the evidence framework, we approximated the integration over \u03b1 and \u03b2 by making point estimates obtained by maximizing the log marginal likelihood. A fully Bayesian approach would integrate over the hyperpa- rameters as well as over the parameters. Although exact integration is intractable, we can use variational methods to \ufb01nd a tractable approximation. In order to sim- plify the discussion, we shall suppose that the noise precision parameter \u03b2 is known, and is \ufb01xed to its true value, although the framework is easily extended to include the distribution over \u03b2. For the linear regression model, the variational treatment Exercise 10.26 will turn out to be equivalent to the evidence framework. Nevertheless, it provides a good exercise in the use of variational methods and will also lay the foundation for variational treatment of Bayesian logistic regression in Section 10.6. Recall that the likelihood function for w, and the prior over w, are given by p(t|w) = N \u000e n=1 N(tn|wT\u03c6n, \u03b2\u22121) (10.87) p(w|\u03b1) = N(w|0, \u03b1\u22121I) (10.88) where \u03c6n = \u03c6(xn). We now introduce a prior distribution over \u03b1. From our dis- cussion in Section 2.3.6, we know that the conjugate prior for the precision of a Gaussian is given by a gamma distribution, and so we choose p(\u03b1) = Gam(\u03b1|a0, b0) (10.89) where Gam(\u00b7|\u00b7, \u00b7) is de\ufb01ned by (B.26). Thus the joint distribution of all the variables is given by p(t, w, \u03b1) = p(t|w)p(w|\u03b1)p(\u03b1). (10.90) This can be represented as a directed graphical model as shown in Figure 10.8. 10.3.1 Variational distribution Our \ufb01rst goal is to \ufb01nd an approximation to the posterior distribution p(w, \u03b1|t).

(10.91) We can \ufb01nd re-estimation equations for the factors in this distribution by making use of the general result (10.9). Recall that for each factor, we take the log of the joint distribution over all variables and then average with respect to those variables not in that factor. Consider \ufb01rst the distribution over \u03b1. Keeping only terms that have a functional dependence on \u03b1, we have ln q\u22c6(\u03b1) = ln p(\u03b1) + Ew [ln p(w|\u03b1)] + const = (a0 \u22121) ln \u03b1 \u2212b0\u03b1 + M 2 ln \u03b1 \u2212\u03b1 2 E[wTw] + const. (10.92) We recognize this as the log of a gamma distribution, and so identifying the coef\ufb01- cients of \u03b1 and ln \u03b1 we obtain q\u22c6(\u03b1) = Gam(\u03b1|aN, bN) (10.93) where aN = a0 + M 2 (10.94) bN = b0 + 1 2E[wTw]. (10.95) Similarly, we can \ufb01nd the variational re-estimation equation for the posterior distribution over w. Again, using the general result (10.9), and keeping only those terms that have a functional dependence on w, we have ln q\u22c6(w) = ln p(t|w) + E\u03b1 [ln p(w|\u03b1)] + const (10.96) = \u2212\u03b2 2 N \u0002 n=1 {wT\u03c6n \u2212tn}2 \u22121 2E[\u03b1]wTw + const (10.97) = \u22121 2wT E[\u03b1]I + \u03b2\u03a6T\u03a6 w + \u03b2wT\u03a6Tt + const.

(10.101) Note the close similarity to the posterior distribution (3.52) obtained when \u03b1 was treated as a \ufb01xed parameter. The difference is that here \u03b1 is replaced by its expecta- tion E[\u03b1] under the variational distribution. Indeed, we have chosen to use the same notation for the covariance matrix SN in both cases. Using the standard results (B.27), (B.38), and (B.39), we can obtain the required moments as follows E[\u03b1] = aN/bN (10.102) E[wwT] = mNmT N + SN. (10.103) The evaluation of the variational posterior distribution begins by initializing the pa- rameters of one of the distributions q(w) or q(\u03b1), and then alternately re-estimates these factors in turn until a suitable convergence criterion is satis\ufb01ed (usually speci- \ufb01ed in terms of the lower bound to be discussed shortly). It is instructive to relate the variational solution to that found using the evidence framework in Section 3.5. To do this consider the case a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding to the limit of an in\ufb01nitely broad prior over \u03b1. The mean of the variational posterior distribution q(\u03b1) is then given by E[\u03b1] = aN bN = M/2 E[wTw]/2 = M mT NmN + Tr(SN). (10.104) Comparison with (9.63) shows that in the case of this particularly simple model, the variational approach gives precisely the same expression as that obtained by maximizing the evidence function using EM except that the point estimate for \u03b1 is replaced by its expected value. Because the distribution q(w) depends on q(\u03b1) only through the expectation E[\u03b1], we see that the two approaches will give identical results for the case of an in\ufb01nitely broad prior. 10.3.2 Predictive distribution The predictive distribution over t, given a new input x, is easily evaluated for this model using the Gaussian variational posterior for the parameters p(t|x, t) = \u0006 p(t|x, w)p(w|t) dw \u2243 \u0006 p(t|x, w)q(w) dw = \u0006 N(t|wT\u03c6(x), \u03b2\u22121)N(w|mN, SN) dw = N(t|mT N\u03c6(x), \u03c32(x)) (10.105)",

Here the prior parameters have been set to a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding to the noninformative prior p(\u03b1) \u221d1/\u03b1, which is uniform over ln \u03b1 as discussed in Section 2.3.6. As we saw in Section 10.1, the quantity L represents lower bound on the log marginal likelihood p(t|M) for the model. If we assign equal prior probabilities p(M) to the different values of M, then we can interpret L as an approximation to the poste- rior model probability p(M|t). Thus the variational framework assigns the highest probability to the model with M = 3. This should be contrasted with the maximum likelihood result, which assigns ever smaller residual error to models of increasing complexity until the residual error is driven to zero, causing maximum likelihood to favour severely over-\ufb01tted models.",

Exponential Family Distributions In Chapter 2, we discussed the important role played by the exponential family of distributions and their conjugate priors. For many of the models discussed in this book, the complete-data likelihood is drawn from the exponential family. However, in general this will not be the case for the marginal likelihood function for the ob- served data. For example, in a mixture of Gaussians, the joint distribution of obser- vations xn and corresponding hidden variables zn is a member of the exponential family, whereas the marginal distribution of xn is a mixture of Gaussians and hence is not. Up to now we have grouped the variables in the model into observed variables and hidden variables. We now make a further distinction between latent variables, denoted Z, and parameters, denoted \u03b8, where parameters are intensive (\ufb01xed in num- ber independent of the size of the data set), whereas latent variables are extensive (scale in number with the size of the data set). For example, in a Gaussian mixture model, the indicator variables zkn (which specify which component k is responsible for generating data point xn) represent the latent variables, whereas the means \u00b5k, precisions \u039bk and mixing proportions \u03c0k represent the parameters. Consider the case of independent identically distributed data. We denote the data values by X = {xn}, where n = 1, . . . N, with corresponding latent variables Z = {zn}. Now suppose that the joint distribution of observed and latent variables is a member of the exponential family, parameterized by natural parameters \u03b7 so that p(X, Z|\u03b7) = N \u000e n=1 h(xn, zn)g(\u03b7) exp \u001a \u03b7Tu(xn, zn) \u001b . (10.113) We shall also use a conjugate prior for \u03b7, which can be written as p(\u03b7|\u03bd0, v0) = f(\u03bd0, \u03c70)g(\u03b7)\u03bd0 exp \u001a \u03bdo\u03b7T\u03c70 \u001b . (10.114) Recall that the conjugate prior distribution can be interpreted as a prior number \u03bd0 of observations all having the value \u03c70 for the u vector. Now consider a variational",

(10.115) Thus we see that this decomposes into a sum of independent terms, one for each value of n, and hence the solution for q\u22c6(Z) will factorize over n so that q\u22c6(Z) = \u0015 n q\u22c6(zn). This is an example of an induced factorization. Taking the exponential Section 10.2.5 of both sides, we have q\u22c6(zn) = h(xn, zn)g (E[\u03b7]) exp \u001a E[\u03b7T]u(xn, zn)\u001b (10.116) where the normalization coef\ufb01cient has been re-instated by comparison with the standard form for the exponential family. Similarly, for the variational distribution over the parameters, we have ln q\u22c6(\u03b7) = ln p(\u03b7|\u03bd0, \u03c70) + EZ[ln p(X, Z|\u03b7)] + const (10.117) = \u03bd0 ln g(\u03b7) + \u03b7T\u03c70 + N \u0002 n=1 \u001a ln g(\u03b7) + \u03b7TEzn[u(xn, zn)]\u001b + const. (10.118) Again, taking the exponential of both sides, and re-instating the normalization coef- \ufb01cient by inspection, we have q\u22c6(\u03b7) = f(\u03bdN, \u03c7N)g(\u03b7)\u03bdN exp \u001a \u03b7T\u03c7N \u001b (10.119) where we have de\ufb01ned \u03bdN = \u03bd0 + N (10.120) \u03c7N = \u03c70 + N \u0002 n=1 Ezn[u(xn, zn)]. (10.121) Note that the solutions for q\u22c6(zn) and q\u22c6(\u03b7) are coupled, and so we solve them iter- atively in a two-stage procedure. In the variational E step, we evaluate the expected suf\ufb01cient statistics E[u(xn, zn)] using the current posterior distribution q(zn) over the latent variables and use this to compute a revised posterior distribution q(\u03b7) over the parameters. Then in the subsequent variational M step, we use this revised pa- rameter posterior distribution to \ufb01nd the expected natural parameters E[\u03b7T], which gives rise to a revised variational distribution over the latent variables. 10.4.1 Variational message passing We have illustrated the application of variational methods by considering a spe- ci\ufb01c model, the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, in some detail.

Here we consider more gen- erally the use of variational methods for models described by directed graphs and derive a number of widely applicable results. The joint distribution corresponding to a directed graph can be written using the decomposition p(x) = \u000e i p(xi|pai) (10.122) where xi denotes the variable(s) associated with node i, and pai denotes the parent set corresponding to node i. Note that xi may be a latent variable or it may belong to the set of observed variables. Now consider a variational approximation in which the distribution q(x) is assumed to factorize with respect to the xi so that q(x) = \u000e i qi(xi). (10.123) Note that for observed nodes, there is no factor q(xi) in the variational distribution. We now substitute (10.122) into our general result (10.9) to give ln q\u22c6 j (xj) = Ei\u0338=j \u0002 i ln p(xi|pai) + const. (10.124) Any terms on the right-hand side that do not depend on xj can be absorbed into the additive constant. In fact, the only terms that do depend on xj are the con- ditional distribution for xj given by p(xj|paj) together with any other conditional distributions that have xj in the conditioning set. By de\ufb01nition, these conditional distributions correspond to the children of node j, and they therefore also depend on the co-parents of the child nodes, i.e., the other parents of the child nodes besides node xj itself. We see that the set of all nodes on which q\u22c6(xj) depends corresponds to the Markov blanket of node xj, as illustrated in Figure 8.26. Thus the update of the factors in the variational posterior distribution represents a local calculation on the graph. This makes possible the construction of general purpose software for variational inference in which the form of the model does not need to be speci\ufb01ed in advance (Bishop et al., 2003). If we now specialize to the case of a model in which all of the conditional dis- tributions have a conjugate-exponential structure, then the variational update proce- dure can be cast in terms of a local message passing algorithm (Winn and Bishop, 2005). In particular, the distribution associated with a particular node can be updated once that node has received messages from all of its parents and all of its children. This in turn requires that the children have already received messages from their co- parents. The evaluation of the lower bound can also be simpli\ufb01ed because many of the required quantities are already evaluated as part of the message passing scheme. This distributed message passing formulation has good scaling properties and is well suited to large networks.",

Local Variational Methods The variational framework discussed in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 can be considered a \u2018global\u2019 method in the sense that it directly seeks an approximation to the full poste- rior distribution over all random variables. An alternative \u2018local\u2019 approach involves \ufb01nding bounds on functions over individual variables or groups of variables within a model. For instance, we might seek a bound on a conditional distribution p(y|x), which is itself just one factor in a much larger probabilistic model speci\ufb01ed by a directed graph. The purpose of introducing the bound of course is to simplify the resulting distribution. This local approximation can be applied to multiple variables in turn until a tractable approximation is obtained, and in Section 10.6.1 we shall give a practical example of this approach in the context of logistic regression. Here we focus on developing the bounds themselves. We have already seen in our discussion of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that the convexity of the logarithm function played a key role in developing the lower bound in the global variational approach. We have de\ufb01ned a (strictly) convex func- tion as one for which every chord lies above the function. Convexity also plays a Section 1.6.1 central role in the local variational framework. Note that our discussion will ap- ply equally to concave functions with \u2018min\u2019 and \u2018max\u2019 interchanged and with lower bounds replaced by upper bounds. Let us begin by considering a simple example, namely the function f(x) = exp(\u2212x), which is a convex function of x, and which is shown in the left-hand plot of Figure 10.10. Our goal is to approximate f(x) by a simpler function, in particular a linear function of x. From Figure 10.10, we see that this linear function will be a lower bound on f(x) if it corresponds to a tangent. We can obtain the tangent line y(x) at a speci\ufb01c value of x, say x = \u03be, by making a \ufb01rst order Taylor expansion y(x) = f(\u03be) + f \u2032(\u03be)(x \u2212\u03be) (10.125) so that y(x) \u2a7df(x) with equality when x = \u03be. For our example function f(x) = Figure 10.10 In the left-hand \ufb01g- ure the red curve shows the function exp(\u2212x), and the blue line shows the tangent at x = \u03be de\ufb01ned by (10.125) with \u03be = 1. This line has slope \u03bb = f \u2032(\u03be) = \u2212exp(\u2212\u03be). Note that any other tangent line, for ex- ample the ones shown in green, will have a smaller value of y at x = \u03be. The right-hand \ufb01gure shows the corresponding plot of the function \u03bb\u03be \u2212g(\u03bb), where g(\u03bb) is given by (10.131), versus \u03bb for \u03be = 1, in which the maximum corresponds to \u03bb = \u2212exp(\u2212\u03be) = \u22121/e. x \u03be 0 1.5 3 0 0.5 1 \u03bb \u03bb\u03be \u2212g(\u03bb) \u22121 \u22120.5 0 0 0.2 0.4",

For the given value of slope \u03bb the contact point of the tangent line having the same slope is found by minimizing with respect to x the discrepancy (shown by the green dashed lines) given by f(x) \u2212\u03bbx. This de\ufb01nes the dual function g(\u03bb), which corresponds to the (negative of the) intercept of the tangent line having slope \u03bb. exp(\u2212x), we therefore obtain the tangent line in the form y(x) = exp(\u2212\u03be) \u2212exp(\u2212\u03be)(x \u2212\u03be) (10.126) which is a linear function parameterized by \u03be. For consistency with subsequent discussion, let us de\ufb01ne \u03bb = \u2212exp(\u2212\u03be) so that y(x, \u03bb) = \u03bbx \u2212\u03bb + \u03bb ln(\u2212\u03bb). (10.127) Different values of \u03bb correspond to different tangent lines, and because all such lines are lower bounds on the function, we have f(x) \u2a7ey(x, \u03bb). Thus we can write the function in the form f(x) = max \u03bb {\u03bbx \u2212\u03bb + \u03bb ln(\u2212\u03bb)} . (10.128) We have succeeded in approximating the convex function f(x) by a simpler, lin- ear function y(x, \u03bb). The price we have paid is that we have introduced a variational parameter \u03bb, and to obtain the tightest bound we must optimize with respect to \u03bb. We can formulate this approach more generally using the framework of convex duality (Rockafellar, 1972; Jordan et al., 1999). Consider the illustration of a convex function f(x) shown in the left-hand plot in Figure 10.11. In this example, the function \u03bbx is a lower bound on f(x) but it is not the best lower bound that can be achieved by a linear function having slope \u03bb, because the tightest bound is given by the tangent line. Let us write the equation of the tangent line, having slope \u03bb as \u03bbx \u2212g(\u03bb) where the (negative) intercept g(\u03bb) clearly depends on the slope \u03bb of the tangent. To determine the intercept, we note that the line must be moved vertically by an amount equal to the smallest vertical distance between the line and the function, as shown in Figure 10.11. Thus g(\u03bb) = \u2212min x {f(x) \u2212\u03bbx} = max x {\u03bbx \u2212f(x)} . (10.129)",

Local Variational Methods 495 Now, instead of \ufb01xing \u03bb and varying x, we can consider a particular x and then adjust \u03bb until the tangent plane is tangent at that particular x. Because the y value of the tangent line at a particular x is maximized when that value coincides with its contact point, we have f(x) = max \u03bb {\u03bbx \u2212g(\u03bb)} . (10.130) We see that the functions f(x) and g(\u03bb) play a dual role, and are related through (10.129) and (10.130). Let us apply these duality relations to our simple example f(x) = exp(\u2212x). From (10.129) we see that the maximizing value of x is given by \u03be = \u2212ln(\u2212\u03bb), and back-substituting we obtain the conjugate function g(\u03bb) in the form g(\u03bb) = \u03bb \u2212\u03bb ln(\u2212\u03bb) (10.131) as obtained previously. The function \u03bb\u03be \u2212g(\u03bb) is shown, for \u03be = 1 in the right-hand plot in Figure 10.10. As a check, we can substitute (10.131) into (10.130), which gives the maximizing value of \u03bb = \u2212exp(\u2212x), and back-substituting then recovers the original function f(x) = exp(\u2212x). For concave functions, we can follow a similar argument to obtain upper bounds, in which max\u2019 is replaced with \u2018min\u2019, so that f(x) = min \u03bb {\u03bbx \u2212g(\u03bb)} (10.132) g(\u03bb) = min x {\u03bbx \u2212f(x)} . (10.133) If the function of interest is not convex (or concave), then we cannot directly apply the method above to obtain a bound. However, we can \ufb01rst seek invertible transformations either of the function or of its argument which change it into a con- vex form. We then calculate the conjugate function and then transform back to the original variables. An important example, which arises frequently in pattern recognition, is the logistic sigmoid function de\ufb01ned by \u03c3(x) = 1 1 + e\u2212x . (10.134) As it stands this function is neither convex nor concave. However, if we take the logarithm we obtain a function which is concave, as is easily veri\ufb01ed by \ufb01nding the second derivative. From (10.133) the corresponding conjugate function then takes Exercise 10.30 the form g(\u03bb) = min x {\u03bbx \u2212f(x)} = \u2212\u03bb ln \u03bb \u2212(1 \u2212\u03bb) ln(1 \u2212\u03bb) (10.135) which we recognize as the binary entropy function for a variable whose probability of having the value 1 is \u03bb.

We can also obtain a lower bound on the sigmoid having the functional form of a Gaussian. To do this, we follow Jaakkola and Jordan (2000) and make transforma- tions both of the input variable and of the function itself. First we take the log of the logistic function and then decompose it so that ln \u03c3(x) = \u2212ln(1 + e\u2212x) = \u2212ln \u001a e\u2212x/2(ex/2 + e\u2212x/2) \u001b = x/2 \u2212ln(ex/2 + e\u2212x/2).

We see that the bound has the form of the exponential of a quadratic function of x, which will prove useful when we seek Gaussian representations of posterior distributions de\ufb01ned through logistic sigmoid functions. Section 4.5 The logistic sigmoid arises frequently in probabilistic models over binary vari- ables because it is the function that transforms a log odds ratio into a posterior prob- ability. The corresponding transformation for a multiclass distribution is given by the softmax function. Unfortunately, the lower bound derived here for the logistic Section 4.3 sigmoid does not directly extend to the softmax. Gibbs (1997) proposes a method for constructing a Gaussian distribution that is conjectured to be a bound (although no rigorous proof is given), which may be used to apply local variational methods to multiclass problems. We shall see an example of the use of local variational bounds in Sections 10.6.1. For the moment, however, it is instructive to consider in general terms how these bounds can be used. Suppose we wish to evaluate an integral of the form I = \u0006 \u03c3(a)p(a) da (10.145) where \u03c3(a) is the logistic sigmoid, and p(a) is a Gaussian probability density. Such integrals arise in Bayesian models when, for instance, we wish to evaluate the pre- dictive distribution, in which case p(a) represents a posterior parameter distribution. Because the integral is intractable, we employ the variational bound (10.144), which we write in the form \u03c3(a) \u2a7ef(a, \u03be) where \u03be is a variational parameter. The inte- gral now becomes the product of two exponential-quadratic functions and so can be integrated analytically to give a bound on I I \u2a7e \u0006 f(a, \u03be)p(a) da = F(\u03be). (10.146) We now have the freedom to choose the variational parameter \u03be, which we do by \ufb01nding the value \u03be\u22c6that maximizes the function F(\u03be). The resulting value F(\u03be\u22c6) represents the tightest bound within this family of bounds and can be used as an approximation to I. This optimized bound, however, will in general not be exact.",

APPROXIMATE INFERENCE Although the bound \u03c3(a) \u2a7ef(a, \u03be) on the logistic sigmoid can be optimized exactly, the required choice for \u03be depends on the value of a, so that the bound is exact for one value of a only. Because the quantity F(\u03be) is obtained by integrating over all values of a, the value of \u03be\u22c6represents a compromise, weighted by the distribution p(a). 10.6. Variational Logistic Regression We now illustrate the use of local variational methods by returning to the Bayesian logistic regression model studied in Section 4.5. There we focussed on the use of the Laplace approximation, while here we consider a variational treatment based on the approach of Jaakkola and Jordan (2000). Like the Laplace method, this also leads to a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. However, the greater \ufb02exibility of the variational approximation leads to improved accuracy compared to the Laplace method. Furthermore (unlike the Laplace method), the variational approach is optimizing a well de\ufb01ned objective function given by a rigourous bound on the model evidence. Logistic regression has also been treated by Dybowski and Roberts (2005) from a Bayesian perspective using Monte Carlo sampling techniques. 10.6.1 Variational posterior distribution Here we shall make use of a variational approximation based on the local bounds introduced in Section 10.5. This allows the likelihood function for logistic regres- sion, which is governed by the logistic sigmoid, to be approximated by the expo- nential of a quadratic form. It is therefore again convenient to choose a conjugate Gaussian prior of the form (4.140). For the moment, we shall treat the hyperparam- eters m0 and S0 as \ufb01xed constants. In Section 10.6.3, we shall demonstrate how the variational formalism can be extended to the case where there are unknown hyper- parameters whose values are to be inferred from the data. In the variational framework, we seek to maximize a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. For the Bayesian logistic regression model, the marginal likelihood takes the form p(t) = \u0006 p(t|w)p(w) dw = \u0006 N \u000e n=1 p(tn|w) p(w) dw. (10.147) We \ufb01rst note that the conditional distribution for t can be written as p(t|w) = \u03c3(a)t {1 \u2212\u03c3(a)}1\u2212t = \u000f 1 1 + e\u2212a \u0010t \u000f 1 \u2212 1 1 + e\u2212a \u00101\u2212t = eat e\u2212a 1 + e\u2212a = eat\u03c3(\u2212a) (10.148) where a = wT\u03c6. In order to obtain a lower bound on p(t), we make use of the variational lower bound on the logistic sigmoid function given by (10.144), which",

Once it is normalized to give a variational posterior distribution q(w), however, it no longer represents a bound. Because the logarithm function is monotonically increasing, the inequality A \u2a7e B implies ln A \u2a7eln B. This gives a lower bound on the log of the joint distribution of t and w of the form ln {p(t|w)p(w)} \u2a7eln p(w) + N \u0002 n=1 \u001a ln \u03c3(\u03ben) + wT\u03c6ntn \u2212(wT\u03c6n + \u03ben)/2 \u2212\u03bb(\u03ben)([wT\u03c6n]2 \u2212\u03be2 n) \u001b .

However, the additional \ufb02exibility provided by the vari- ational parameters {\u03ben} leads to improved accuracy in the approximation (Jaakkola and Jordan, 2000). Here we have considered a batch learning context in which all of the training data is available at once. However, Bayesian methods are intrinsically well suited to sequential learning in which the data points are processed one at a time and then discarded. The formulation of this variational approach for the sequential case is straightforward. Exercise 10.32 Note that the bound given by (10.149) applies only to the two-class problem and so this approach does not directly generalize to classi\ufb01cation problems with K > 2 classes. An alternative bound for the multiclass case has been explored by Gibbs (1997). 10.6.2 Optimizing the variational parameters We now have a normalized Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution, which we shall use shortly to evaluate the predictive distribution for new data points. First, however, we need to determine the variational parameters {\u03ben} by maximizing the lower bound on the marginal likelihood. To do this, we substitute the inequality (10.152) back into the marginal likeli- hood to give ln p(t) = ln \u0006 p(t|w)p(w) dw \u2a7eln \u0006 h(w, \u03be)p(w) dw = L(\u03be). (10.159) As with the optimization of the hyperparameter \u03b1 in the linear regression model of Section 3.5, there are two approaches to determining the \u03ben. In the \ufb01rst approach, we recognize that the function L(\u03be) is de\ufb01ned by an integration over w and so we can view w as a latent variable and invoke the EM algorithm. In the second approach, we integrate over w analytically and then perform a direct maximization over \u03be. Let us begin by considering the EM approach. The EM algorithm starts by choosing some initial values for the parameters {\u03ben}, which we denote collectively by \u03beold. In the E step of the EM algorithm,",

Noting that p(w) does not depend on \u03be, and substituting for h(w, \u03be) we obtain Q(\u03be, \u03beold) = N \u0002 n=1 \u001a ln \u03c3(\u03ben) \u2212\u03ben/2 \u2212\u03bb(\u03ben)(\u03c6T nE[wwT]\u03c6n \u2212\u03be2 n)\u001b + const (10.161) where \u2018const\u2019 denotes terms that are independent of \u03be. We now set the derivative with respect to \u03ben equal to zero. A few lines of algebra, making use of the de\ufb01nitions of \u03c3(\u03be) and \u03bb(\u03be), then gives 0 = \u03bb\u2032(\u03ben)(\u03c6T nE[wwT]\u03c6n \u2212\u03be2 n). (10.162) We now note that \u03bb\u2032(\u03be) is a monotonic function of \u03be for \u03be \u2a7e0, and that we can restrict attention to nonnegative values of \u03be without loss of generality due to the symmetry of the bound around \u03be = 0. Thus \u03bb\u2032(\u03be) \u0338= 0, and hence we obtain the following re-estimation equations Exercise 10.33 (\u03benew n )2 = \u03c6T nE[wwT]\u03c6n = \u03c6T n SN + mNmT N \u03c6n (10.163) where we have used (10.156). Let us summarize the EM algorithm for \ufb01nding the variational posterior distri- bution. We \ufb01rst initialize the variational parameters \u03beold. In the E step, we evaluate the posterior distribution over w given by (10.156), in which the mean and covari- ance are de\ufb01ned by (10.157) and (10.158). In the M step, we then use this variational posterior to compute a new value for \u03be given by (10.163). The E and M steps are repeated until a suitable convergence criterion is satis\ufb01ed, which in practice typically requires only a few iterations. An alternative approach to obtaining re-estimation equations for \u03be is to note that in the integral over w in the de\ufb01nition (10.159) of the lower bound L(\u03be), the integrand has a Gaussian-like form and so the integral can be evaluated analytically. Having evaluated the integral, we can then differentiate with respect to \u03ben. It turns out that this gives rise to exactly the same re-estimation equations as does the EM approach given by (10.163). Exercise 10.34 As we have emphasized already, in the application of variational methods it is useful to be able to evaluate the lower bound L(\u03be) given by (10.159). The integration over w can be performed analytically by noting that p(w) is Gaussian and h(w, \u03be) is the exponential of a quadratic function of w. Thus, by completing the square and making use of the standard result for the normalization coef\ufb01cient of a Gaussian distribution, we can obtain a closed form solution which takes the form Exercise 10.35",

(10.164) This variational framework can also be applied to situations in which the data is arriving sequentially (Jaakkola and Jordan, 2000). In this case we maintain a Gaussian posterior distribution over w, which is initialized using the prior p(w). As each data point arrives, the posterior is updated by making use of the bound (10.151) and then normalized to give an updated posterior distribution. The predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing over the posterior dis- tribution, and takes the same form as for the Laplace approximation discussed in Section 4.5.2. Figure 10.13 shows the variational predictive distributions for a syn- thetic data set. This example provides interesting insights into the concept of \u2018large margin\u2019, which was discussed in Section 7.1 and which has qualitatively similar be- haviour to the Bayesian solution. 10.6.3 Inference of hyperparameters So far, we have treated the hyperparameter \u03b1 in the prior distribution as a known constant. We now extend the Bayesian logistic regression model to allow the value of this parameter to be inferred from the data set. This can be achieved by combining the global and local variational approximations into a single framework, so as to maintain a lower bound on the marginal likelihood at each stage. Such a combined approach was adopted by Bishop and Svens\u00b4en (2003) in the context of a Bayesian treatment of the hierarchical mixture of experts model.",

(10.165) Our analysis is readily extended to more general Gaussian priors, for instance if we wish to associate a different hyperparameter with different subsets of the parame- ters wj. As usual, we consider a conjugate hyperprior over \u03b1 given by a gamma distribution p(\u03b1) = Gam(\u03b1|a0, b0) (10.166) governed by the constants a0 and b0. The marginal likelihood for this model now takes the form p(t) = \u0006\u0006 p(w, \u03b1, t) dw d\u03b1 (10.167) where the joint distribution is given by p(w, \u03b1, t) = p(t|w)p(w|\u03b1)p(\u03b1). (10.168) We are now faced with an analytically intractable integration over w and \u03b1, which we shall tackle by using both the local and global variational approaches in the same model To begin with, we introduce a variational distribution q(w, \u03b1), and then apply the decomposition (10.2), which in this instance takes the form ln p(t) = L(q) + KL(q\u2225p) (10.169) where the lower bound L(q) and the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(q\u2225p) are de- \ufb01ned by L(q) = \u0006\u0006 q(w, \u03b1) ln p(w, \u03b1, t) q(w, \u03b1) dw d\u03b1 (10.170) KL(q\u2225p) = \u2212 \u0006\u0006 q(w, \u03b1) ln p(w, \u03b1|t)) q(w, \u03b1) dw d\u03b1.

Expectation Propagation We conclude this chapter by discussing an alternative form of deterministic approx- imate inference, known as expectation propagation or EP (Minka, 2001a; Minka, 2001b). As with the variational Bayes methods discussed so far, this too is based on the minimization of a Kullback-Leibler divergence but now of the reverse form, which gives the approximation rather different properties. Consider for a moment the problem of minimizing KL(p\u2225q) with respect to q(z) when p(z) is a \ufb01xed distribution and q(z) is a member of the exponential family and so, from (2.194), can be written in the form q(z) = h(z)g(\u03b7) exp \u001a \u03b7Tu(z)\u001b . (10.184) As a function of \u03b7, the Kullback-Leibler divergence then becomes KL(p\u2225q) = \u2212ln g(\u03b7) \u2212\u03b7TEp(z)[u(z)] + const (10.185) where the constant terms are independent of the natural parameters \u03b7. We can mini- mize KL(p\u2225q) within this family of distributions by setting the gradient with respect to \u03b7 to zero, giving \u2212\u2207ln g(\u03b7) = Ep(z)[u(z)]. (10.186) However, we have already seen in (2.226) that the negative gradient of ln g(\u03b7) is given by the expectation of u(z) under the distribution q(z). Equating these two results, we obtain Eq(z)[u(z)] = Ep(z)[u(z)]. (10.187)",

So, for instance, if q(z) is a Gaussian N(z|\u00b5, \u03a3) then we minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence by setting the mean \u00b5 of q(z) equal to the mean of the distribution p(z) and the covariance \u03a3 equal to the covariance of p(z). This is sometimes called moment matching. An example of this was seen in Figure 10.3(a). Now let us exploit this result to obtain a practical algorithm for approximate inference. For many probabilistic models, the joint distribution of data D and hidden variables (including parameters) \u03b8 comprises a product of factors in the form p(D, \u03b8) = \u000e i fi(\u03b8). (10.188) This would arise, for example, in a model for independent, identically distributed data in which there is one factor fn(\u03b8) = p(xn|\u03b8) for each data point xn, along with a factor f0(\u03b8) = p(\u03b8) corresponding to the prior. More generally, it would also apply to any model de\ufb01ned by a directed probabilistic graph in which each factor is a conditional distribution corresponding to one of the nodes, or an undirected graph in which each factor is a clique potential. We are interested in evaluating the posterior distribution p(\u03b8|D) for the purpose of making predictions, as well as the model evidence p(D) for the purpose of model comparison. From (10.188) the posterior is given by p(\u03b8|D) = 1 p(D) \u000e i fi(\u03b8) (10.189) and the model evidence is given by p(D) = \u0006 \u000e i fi(\u03b8) d\u03b8. (10.190) Here we are considering continuous variables, but the following discussion applies equally to discrete variables with integrals replaced by summations. We shall sup- pose that the marginalization over \u03b8, along with the marginalizations with respect to the posterior distribution required to make predictions, are intractable so that some form of approximation is required. Expectation propagation is based on an approximation to the posterior distribu- tion which is also given by a product of factors q(\u03b8) = 1 Z \u000e i \u0004fi(\u03b8) (10.191) in which each factor \u0004fi(\u03b8) in the approximation corresponds to one of the factors fi(\u03b8) in the true posterior (10.189), and the factor 1/Z is the normalizing constant needed to ensure that the left-hand side of (10.191) integrates to unity. In order to obtain a practical algorithm, we need to constrain the factors \u0004fi(\u03b8) in some way, and in particular we shall assume that they come from the exponential family. The product of the factors will therefore also be from the exponential family and so can",

For example, if each of the \u0004fi(\u03b8) is a Gaussian, then the overall approximation q(\u03b8) will also be Gaussian. Ideally we would like to determine the \u0004fi(\u03b8) by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and the approximation given by KL (p\u2225q) = KL \u0016 1 p(D) \u000e i fi(\u03b8) ''''' 1 Z \u000e i \u0004fi(\u03b8) \u0017 . (10.192) Note that this is the reverse form of KL divergence compared with that used in varia- tional inference. In general, this minimization will be intractable because the KL di- vergence involves averaging with respect to the true distribution. As a rough approx- imation, we could instead minimize the KL divergences between the corresponding pairs fi(\u03b8) and \u0004fi(\u03b8) of factors. This represents a much simpler problem to solve, and has the advantage that the algorithm is noniterative. However, because each fac- tor is individually approximated, the product of the factors could well give a poor approximation. Expectation propagation makes a much better approximation by optimizing each factor in turn in the context of all of the remaining factors. It starts by initializing the factors \u0004fi(\u03b8), and then cycles through the factors re\ufb01ning them one at a time. This is similar in spirit to the update of factors in the variational Bayes framework considered earlier. Suppose we wish to re\ufb01ne factor \u0004fj(\u03b8). We \ufb01rst remove this factor from the product to give \u0015 i\u0338=j \u0004fi(\u03b8). Conceptually, we will now determine a revised form of the factor \u0004fj(\u03b8) by ensuring that the product qnew(\u03b8) \u221d\u0004fj(\u03b8) \u000e i\u0338=j \u0004fi(\u03b8) (10.193) is as close as possible to fj(\u03b8) \u000e i\u0338=j \u0004fi(\u03b8) (10.194) in which we keep \ufb01xed all of the factors \u0004fi(\u03b8) for i \u0338= j. This ensures that the approximation is most accurate in the regions of high posterior probability as de\ufb01ned by the remaining factors. We shall see an example of this effect when we apply EP to the \u2018clutter problem\u2019. To achieve this, we \ufb01rst remove the factor \u0004fj(\u03b8) from the Section 10.7.1 current approximation to the posterior by de\ufb01ning the unnormalized distribution q\\j(\u03b8) = q(\u03b8) \u0004fj(\u03b8) . (10.195) Note that we could instead \ufb01nd q\\j(\u03b8) from the product of factors i \u0338= j, although in practice division is usually easier. This is now combined with the factor fj(\u03b8) to give a distribution 1 Zj fj(\u03b8)q\\j(\u03b8) (10.196)",

(10.198) This is easily solved because the approximating distribution qnew(\u03b8) is from the ex- ponential family, and so we can appeal to the result (10.187), which tells us that the parameters of qnew(\u03b8) are obtained by matching its expected suf\ufb01cient statistics to the corresponding moments of (10.196). We shall assume that this is a tractable oper- ation. For example, if we choose q(\u03b8) to be a Gaussian distribution N(\u03b8|\u00b5, \u03a3), then \u00b5 is set equal to the mean of the (unnormalized) distribution fj(\u03b8)q\\j(\u03b8), and \u03a3 is set to its covariance. More generally, it is straightforward to obtain the required ex- pectations for any member of the exponential family, provided it can be normalized, because the expected statistics can be related to the derivatives of the normalization coef\ufb01cient, as given by (2.226). The EP approximation is illustrated in Figure 10.14. From (10.193), we see that the revised factor \u0004fj(\u03b8) can be found by taking qnew(\u03b8) and dividing out the remaining factors so that \u0004fj(\u03b8) = K qnew(\u03b8) q\\j(\u03b8) (10.199) where we have used (10.195).

In practice, several passes are made through the set of factors, revising each factor in turn. The posterior distribution p(\u03b8|D) is then approximated using (10.191), and the model evidence p(D) can be approximated by using (10.190) with the factors fi(\u03b8) replaced by their approximations \u0004fi(\u03b8).

(10.208) A special case of EP, known as assumed density \ufb01ltering (ADF) or moment matching (Maybeck, 1982; Lauritzen, 1992; Boyen and Koller, 1998; Opper and Winther, 1999), is obtained by initializing all of the approximating factors except the \ufb01rst to unity and then making one pass through the factors updating each of them once. Assumed density \ufb01ltering can be appropriate for on-line learning in which data points are arriving in a sequence and we need to learn from each data point and then discard it before considering the next point. However, in a batch setting we have the opportunity to re-use the data points many times in order to achieve improved ac- curacy, and it is this idea that is exploited in expectation propagation. Furthermore, if we apply ADF to batch data, the results will have an undesirable dependence on the (arbitrary) order in which the data points are considered, which again EP can overcome. One disadvantage of expectation propagation is that there is no guarantee that the iterations will converge. However, for approximations q(\u03b8) in the exponential family, if the iterations do converge, the resulting solution will be a stationary point of a particular energy function (Minka, 2001a), although each iteration of EP does not necessarily decrease the value of this energy function. This is in contrast to variational Bayes, which iteratively maximizes a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood, in which each iteration is guaranteed not to decrease the bound. It is possible to optimize the EP cost function directly, in which case it is guaranteed to converge, although the resulting algorithms can be slower and more complex to implement. Another difference between variational Bayes and EP arises from the form of KL divergence that is minimized by the two algorithms, because the former mini- mizes KL(q\u2225p) whereas the latter minimizes KL(p\u2225q). As we saw in Figure 10.3, for distributions p(\u03b8) which are multimodal, minimizing KL(p\u2225q) can lead to poor approximations. In particular, if EP is applied to mixtures the results are not sen- sible because the approximation tries to capture all of the modes of the posterior distribution. Conversely, in logistic-type models, EP often out-performs both local variational methods and the Laplace approximation (Kuss and Rasmussen, 2006).",

To make the problem more interesting, the observations are embedded in background clutter, which itself is also Gaussian distributed, as illustrated in Figure 10.15. The distribu- tion of observed values x is therefore a mixture of Gaussians, which we take to be of the form p(x|\u03b8) = (1 \u2212w)N(x|\u03b8, I) + wN(x|0, aI) (10.209) where w is the proportion of background clutter and is assumed to be known. The prior over \u03b8 is taken to be Gaussian p(\u03b8) = N(\u03b8|0, bI) (10.210) and Minka (2001a) chooses the parameter values a = 10, b = 100 and w = 0.5.

Thus the computational cost of solving this problem exactly would grow exponentially with the size of the data set, and so an exact solution is intractable for moderately large N. To apply EP to the clutter problem, we \ufb01rst identify the factors f0(\u03b8) = p(\u03b8) and fn(\u03b8) = p(xn|\u03b8). Next we select an approximating distribution from the expo- nential family, and for this example it is convenient to choose a spherical Gaussian q(\u03b8) = N(\u03b8|m, vI). (10.212)",

Note that the use of N(\u03b8|\u00b7, \u00b7) does not imply that the right-hand side is a well-de\ufb01ned Gaussian density (in fact, as we shall see, the variance parameter vn can be negative) but is simply a convenient shorthand notation.

First we remove the current estimate \u0004fn(\u03b8) from q(\u03b8) by division using (10.205) to give q\\n(\u03b8), which has mean and inverse variance given by Exercise 10.38 m\\n = m + v\\nv\u22121 n (m \u2212mn) (10.214) (v\\n)\u22121 = v\u22121 \u2212v\u22121 n .

To start with, we show this in the context of a simple example, and then we shall explore the general case. First of all, recall from (10.17) that if we minimize the Kullback-Leibler diver- gence KL(p\u2225q) with respect to a factorized distribution q, then the optimal solution for each factor is simply the corresponding marginal of p. Now consider the factor graph shown on the left in Figure 10.18, which was introduced earlier in the context of the sum-product algorithm. The joint distribution Section 8.4.4 is given by p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x2, x3)fc(x2, x4). (10.225) We seek an approximation q(x) that has the same factorization, so that q(x) \u221d\u0004fa(x1, x2)\u0004fb(x2, x3)\u0004fc(x2, x4). (10.226) Note that normalization constants have been omitted, and these can be re-instated at the end by local normalization, as is generally done in belief propagation.

Simi- larly, if we substitute (8.78) into (8.79), we obtain (10.235) in which \u0004fa2(x2) corre- sponds to \u00b5fa\u2192x2(x2) and \u0004fc2(x2) corresponds to \u00b5fc\u2192x2(x2), giving the message \u0004fb3(x3) which corresponds to \u00b5fb\u2192x3(x3). This result differs slightly from standard belief propagation in that messages are passed in both directions at the same time. We can easily modify the EP procedure to give the standard form of the sum-product algorithm by updating just one of the factors at a time, for instance if we re\ufb01ne only \u0004fb3(x3), then \u0004fb2(x2) is unchanged by de\ufb01nition, while the re\ufb01ned version of \u0004fb3(x3) is again given by (10.235). If we are re\ufb01ning only one term at a time, then we can choose the order in which the re\ufb01nements are done as we wish. In particular, for a tree-structured graph we can follow a two-pass update scheme, corresponding to the standard belief propagation schedule, which will result in exact inference of the variable and factor marginals. The initialization of the approximation factors in this case is unimportant. Now let us consider a general factor graph corresponding to the distribution p(\u03b8) = \u000e i fi(\u03b8i) (10.236) where \u03b8i represents the subset of variables associated with factor fi. We approximate this using a fully factorized distribution of the form q(\u03b8) \u221d \u000e i \u000e k \u0004fik(\u03b8k) (10.237) where \u03b8k corresponds to an individual variable node. Suppose that we wish to re\ufb01ne the particular term \u0004fjl(\u03b8l) keeping all other terms \ufb01xed. We \ufb01rst remove the term \u0004fj(\u03b8j) from q(\u03b8) to give q\\j(\u03b8) \u221d \u000e i\u0338=j \u000e k \u0004fik(\u03b8k) (10.238) and then multiply by the exact factor fj(\u03b8j). To determine the re\ufb01ned term \u0004fjl(\u03b8l), we need only consider the functional dependence on \u03b8l, and so we simply \ufb01nd the corresponding marginal of q\\j(\u03b8)fj(\u03b8j). (10.239) Up to a multiplicative constant, this involves taking the marginal of fj(\u03b8j) multiplied by any terms from q\\j(\u03b8) that are functions of any of the variables in \u03b8j. Terms that correspond to other factors \u0004fi(\u03b8i) for i \u0338= j will cancel between numerator and denominator when we subsequently divide by q\\j(\u03b8). We therefore obtain \u0004fjl(\u03b8l) \u221d \u0002 \u03b8m\u0338=l\u2208\u03b8j fj(\u03b8j) \u000e k \u000e m\u0338=l \u0004fkm(\u03b8m). (10.240)",

The quantity \u0004fjm(\u03b8m) corresponds to the message \u00b5fj\u2192\u03b8m(\u03b8m), which factor node j sends to variable node m, and the product over k in (10.240) is over all factors that depend on the variables \u03b8m that have variables (other than variable \u03b8l) in common with factor fj(\u03b8j). In other words, to compute the outgoing message from a factor node, we take the product of all the incoming messages from other factor nodes, multiply by the local factor, and then marginalize. Thus, the sum-product algorithm arises as a special case of expectation propa- gation if we use an approximating distribution that is fully factorized. This suggests that more \ufb02exible approximating distributions, corresponding to partially discon- nected graphs, could be used to achieve higher accuracy. Another generalization is to group factors fi(\u03b8i) together into sets and to re\ufb01ne all the factors in a set together at each iteration. Both of these approaches can lead to improvements in accuracy (Minka, 2001b). In general, the problem of choosing the best combination of group- ing and disconnection is an open research issue. We have seen that variational message passing and expectation propagation op- timize two different forms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Minka (2005) has shown that a broad range of message passing algorithms can be derived from a com- mon framework involving minimization of members of the alpha family of diver- gences, given by (10.19). These include variational message passing, loopy belief propagation, and expectation propagation, as well as a range of other algorithms, which we do not have space to discuss here, such as tree-reweighted message pass- ing (Wainwright et al., 2005), fractional belief propagation (Wiegerinck and Heskes, 2003), and power EP (Minka, 2004).

This is illustrated schematically for a single continuous variable in Figure 11.1. We shall suppose that such expectations are too complex to be evaluated exactly using analyt- ical techniques.

The joint distribution is speci\ufb01ed by p(z) = M \u000e i=1 p(zi|pai) (11.4) where zi are the set of variables associated with node i, and pai denotes the set of variables associated with the parents of node i. To obtain a sample from the joint distribution, we make one pass through the set of variables in the order z1, . . . , zM sampling from the conditional distributions p(zi|pai). This is always possible be- cause at each step all of the parent values will have been instantiated. After one pass through the graph, we will have obtained a sample from the joint distribution. Now consider the case of a directed graph in which some of the nodes are in- stantiated with observed values. We can in principle extend the above procedure, at least in the case of nodes representing discrete variables, to give the following logic sampling approach (Henrion, 1988), which can be seen as a special case of impor- tance sampling discussed in Section 11.1.4. At each step, when a sampled value is obtained for a variable zi whose value is observed, the sampled value is compared to the observed value, and if they agree then the sample value is retained and the al- gorithm proceeds to the next variable in turn. However, if the sampled value and the observed value disagree, then the whole sample so far is discarded and the algorithm starts again with the \ufb01rst node in the graph. This algorithm samples correctly from the posterior distribution because it corresponds simply to drawing samples from the joint distribution of hidden variables and data variables and then discarding those samples that disagree with the observed data (with the slight saving of not continu- ing with the sampling from the joint distribution as soon as one contradictory value is observed). However, the overall probability of accepting a sample from the posterior decreases rapidly as the number of observed variables increases and as the number of states that those variables can take increases, and so this approach is rarely used in practice. In the case of probability distributions de\ufb01ned by an undirected graph, there is no one-pass sampling strategy that will sample even from the prior distribution with no observed variables. Instead, computationally more expensive techniques must be employed, such as Gibbs sampling, which is discussed in Section 11.3. As well as sampling from conditional distributions, we may also require samples from a marginal distribution. If we already have a strategy for sampling from a joint distribution p(u, v), then it is straightforward to obtain samples from the marginal distribution p(u) simply by ignoring the values for v in each sample. There are numerous texts dealing with Monte Carlo methods. Those of partic- ular interest from the statistical inference perspective include Chen et al. (2001), Gamerman (1997), Gilks et al. (1996), Liu (2001), Neal (1996), and Robert and Casella (1999). Also there are review articles by Besag et al.

Diagnostic tests for convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are summarized in Robert and Casella (1999), and some practical guidance on the use of sampling methods in the context of machine learning is given in Bishop and Nabney (2008). 11.1. Basic Sampling Algorithms In this section, we consider some simple strategies for generating random samples from a given distribution. Because the samples will be generated by a computer algorithm they will in fact be pseudo-random numbers, that is, they will be deter- ministically calculated, but must nevertheless pass appropriate tests for randomness. Generating such numbers raises several subtleties (Press et al., 1992) that lie outside the scope of this book. Here we shall assume that an algorithm has been provided that generates pseudo-random numbers distributed uniformly over (0, 1), and indeed most software environments have such a facility built in. 11.1.1 Standard distributions We \ufb01rst consider how to generate random numbers from simple nonuniform dis- tributions, assuming that we already have available a source of uniformly distributed random numbers. Suppose that z is uniformly distributed over the interval (0, 1), and that we transform the values of z using some function f(\u00b7) so that y = f(z). The distribution of y will be governed by p(y) = p(z) \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 dz dy \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 (11.5) where, in this case, p(z) = 1. Our goal is to choose the function f(z) such that the resulting values of y have some speci\ufb01c desired distribution p(y). Integrating (11.5) we obtain z = h(y) \u2261 \u0006 y \u2212\u221e p(\u0001y) d\u0001y (11.6) which is the inde\ufb01nite integral of p(y). Thus, y = h\u22121(z), and so we have to Exercise 11.2 transform the uniformly distributed random numbers using a function which is the inverse of the inde\ufb01nite integral of the desired distribution. This is illustrated in Figure 11.2. Consider for example the exponential distribution p(y) = \u03bb exp(\u2212\u03bby) (11.7) where 0 \u2a7dy < \u221e. In this case the lower limit of the integral in (11.6) is 0, and so h(y) = 1 \u2212exp(\u2212\u03bby). Thus, if we transform our uniformly distributed variable z using y = \u2212\u03bb\u22121 ln(1 \u2212z), then y will have an exponential distribution.",

If y has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance, then \u03c3y + \u00b5 will have a Gaussian distribution with mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32. To generate vector- valued variables having a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean \u00b5 and co- variance \u03a3, we can make use of the Cholesky decomposition, which takes the form \u03a3 = LLT (Press et al., 1992). Then, if z is a vector valued random variable whose components are independent and Gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit vari- ance, then y = \u00b5 + Lz will have mean \u00b5 and covariance \u03a3. Exercise 11.5 Obviously, the transformation technique depends for its success on the ability to calculate and then invert the inde\ufb01nite integral of the required distribution. Such operations will only be feasible for a limited number of simple distributions, and so we must turn to alternative approaches in search of a more general strategy. Here we consider two techniques called rejection sampling and importance sampling. Al- though mainly limited to univariate distributions and thus not directly applicable to complex problems in many dimensions, they do form important components in more general strategies. 11.1.2 Rejection sampling The rejection sampling framework allows us to sample from relatively complex distributions, subject to certain constraints. We begin by considering univariate dis- tributions and discuss the extension to multiple dimensions subsequently. Suppose we wish to sample from a distribution p(z) that is not one of the simple, standard distributions considered so far, and that sampling directly from p(z) is dif- \ufb01cult. Furthermore suppose, as is often the case, that we are easily able to evaluate p(z) for any given value of z, up to some normalizing constant Z, so that p(z) = 1 Zp \u0004p(z) (11.13) where \u0004p(z) can readily be evaluated, but Zp is unknown. In order to apply rejection sampling, we need some simpler distribution q(z), sometimes called a proposal distribution, from which we can readily draw samples.",

Basic Sampling Algorithms 529 Figure 11.4 In the rejection sampling method, samples are drawn from a sim- ple distribution q(z) and rejected if they fall in the grey area be- tween the unnormalized distribu- tion ep(z) and the scaled distribu- tion kq(z). The resulting samples are distributed according to p(z), which is the normalized version of ep(z). z0 z u0 kq(z0) kq(z) \u02dcp(z) We next introduce a constant k whose value is chosen such that kq(z) \u2a7e\u0004p(z) for all values of z. The function kq(z) is called the comparison function and is illus- trated for a univariate distribution in Figure 11.4. Each step of the rejection sampler involves generating two random numbers. First, we generate a number z0 from the distribution q(z). Next, we generate a number u0 from the uniform distribution over [0, kq(z0)]. This pair of random numbers has uniform distribution under the curve of the function kq(z). Finally, if u0 > \u0004p(z0) then the sample is rejected, otherwise u0 is retained. Thus the pair is rejected if it lies in the grey shaded region in Fig- ure 11.4. The remaining pairs then have uniform distribution under the curve of \u0004p(z), and hence the corresponding z values are distributed according to p(z), as desired. Exercise 11.6 The original values of z are generated from the distribution q(z), and these sam- ples are then accepted with probability \u0004p(z)/kq(z), and so the probability that a sample will be accepted is given by p(accept) = \u0006 {\u0004p(z)/kq(z)} q(z) dz = 1 k \u0006 \u0004p(z) dz. (11.14) Thus the fraction of points that are rejected by this method depends on the ratio of the area under the unnormalized distribution \u0004p(z) to the area under the curve kq(z). We therefore see that the constant k should be as small as possible subject to the limitation that kq(z) must be nowhere less than \u0004p(z). As an illustration of the use of rejection sampling, consider the task of sampling from the gamma distribution Gam(z|a, b) = baza\u22121 exp(\u2212bz) \u0393(a) (11.15) which, for a > 1, has a bell-shaped form, as shown in Figure 11.5. A suitable proposal distribution is therefore the Cauchy (11.8) because this too is bell-shaped and because we can use the transformation method, discussed earlier, to sample from it. We need to generalize the Cauchy slightly to ensure that it nowhere has a smaller value than the gamma distribution. This can be achieved by transforming a uniform random variable y using z = b tan y + c, which gives random numbers distributed according to. Exercise 11.7",

The resulting comparison function is also illustrated in Figure 11.5. 11.1.3 Adaptive rejection sampling In many instances where we might wish to apply rejection sampling, it proves dif\ufb01cult to determine a suitable analytic form for the envelope distribution q(z). An alternative approach is to construct the envelope function on the \ufb02y based on mea- sured values of the distribution p(z) (Gilks and Wild, 1992). Construction of an envelope function is particularly straightforward for cases in which p(z) is log con- cave, in other words when ln p(z) has derivatives that are nonincreasing functions of z. The construction of a suitable envelope function is illustrated graphically in Figure 11.6. The function ln p(z) and its gradient are evaluated at some initial set of grid points, and the intersections of the resulting tangent lines are used to construct the envelope function. Next a sample value is drawn from the envelope distribution. This is straightforward because the log of the envelope distribution is a succession Exercise 11.9 Figure 11.6 In the case of distributions that are log concave, an envelope function for use in rejection sampling can be constructed using the tangent lines computed at a set of grid points.

(11.17) Once a sample has been drawn, the usual rejection criterion can be applied. If the sample is accepted, then it will be a draw from the desired distribution. If, however, the sample is rejected, then it is incorporated into the set of grid points, a new tangent line is computed, and the envelope function is thereby re\ufb01ned. As the number of grid points increases, so the envelope function becomes a better approximation of the desired distribution p(z) and the probability of rejection decreases. A variant of the algorithm exists that avoids the evaluation of derivatives (Gilks, 1992). The adaptive rejection sampling framework can also be extended to distri- butions that are not log concave, simply by following each rejection sampling step with a Metropolis-Hastings step (to be discussed in Section 11.2.2), giving rise to adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (Gilks et al., 1995). Clearly for rejection sampling to be of practical value, we require that the com- parison function be close to the required distribution so that the rate of rejection is kept to a minimum. Now let us examine what happens when we try to use rejection sampling in spaces of high dimensionality. Consider, for the sake of illustration, a somewhat arti\ufb01cial problem in which we wish to sample from a zero-mean mul- tivariate Gaussian distribution with covariance \u03c32 pI, where I is the unit matrix, by rejection sampling from a proposal distribution that is itself a zero-mean Gaussian distribution having covariance \u03c32 qI. Obviously, we must have \u03c32 q \u2a7e\u03c32 p in order that there exists a k such that kq(z) \u2a7ep(z). In D-dimensions the optimum value of k is given by k = (\u03c3q/\u03c3p)D, as illustrated for D = 1 in Figure 11.7. The acceptance rate will be the ratio of volumes under p(z) and kq(z), which, because both distribu- tions are normalized, is just 1/k. Thus the acceptance rate diminishes exponentially with dimensionality. Even if \u03c3q exceeds \u03c3p by just one percent, for D = 1, 000 the acceptance ratio will be approximately 1/20, 000. In this illustrative example the comparison function is close to the required distribution. For more practical exam- ples, where the desired distribution may be multimodal and sharply peaked, it will be extremely dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd a good proposal distribution and comparison function.",

SAMPLING METHODS Figure 11.8 Importance sampling addresses the prob- lem of evaluating the expectation of a func- tion f(z) with respect to a distribution p(z) from which it is dif\ufb01cult to draw samples di- rectly. Instead, samples {z(l)} are drawn from a simpler distribution q(z), and the corresponding terms in the summation are weighted by the ratios p(z(l))/q(z(l)). p(z) f(z) z q(z) Furthermore, the exponential decrease of acceptance rate with dimensionality is a generic feature of rejection sampling. Although rejection can be a useful technique in one or two dimensions it is unsuited to problems of high dimensionality. It can, however, play a role as a subroutine in more sophisticated algorithms for sampling in high dimensional spaces. 11.1.4 Importance sampling One of the principal reasons for wishing to sample from complicated probability distributions is to be able to evaluate expectations of the form (11.1). The technique of importance sampling provides a framework for approximating expectations di- rectly but does not itself provide a mechanism for drawing samples from distribution p(z). The \ufb01nite sum approximation to the expectation, given by (11.2), depends on being able to draw samples from the distribution p(z). Suppose, however, that it is impractical to sample directly from p(z) but that we can evaluate p(z) easily for any given value of z. One simplistic strategy for evaluating expectations would be to discretize z-space into a uniform grid and to evaluate the integrand as a sum of the form E[f] \u2243 L \u0002 l=1 p(z(l))f(z(l)). (11.18) An obvious problem with this approach is that the number of terms in the summation grows exponentially with the dimensionality of z. Furthermore, as we have already noted, the kinds of probability distributions of interest will often have much of their mass con\ufb01ned to relatively small regions of z space and so uniform sampling will be very inef\ufb01cient because in high-dimensional problems, only a very small proportion of the samples will make a signi\ufb01cant contribution to the sum. We would really like to choose the sample points to fall in regions where p(z) is large, or ideally where the product p(z)f(z) is large. As in the case of rejection sampling, importance sampling is based on the use of a proposal distribution q(z) from which it is easy to draw samples, as illustrated in Figure 11.8. We can then express the expectation in the form of a \ufb01nite sum over",

It will often be the case that the distribution p(z) can only be evaluated up to a normalization constant, so that p(z) = \u0004p(z)/Zp where \u0004p(z) can be evaluated easily, whereas Zp is unknown.

If, as is often the case, p(z)f(z) is strongly varying and has a sig- ni\ufb01cant proportion of its mass concentrated over relatively small regions of z space, then the set of importance weights {rl} may be dominated by a few weights hav- ing large values, with the remaining weights being relatively insigni\ufb01cant. Thus the effective sample size can be much smaller than the apparent sample size L. The prob- lem is even more severe if none of the samples falls in the regions where p(z)f(z) is large. In that case, the apparent variances of rl and rlf(z(l)) may be small even though the estimate of the expectation may be severely wrong. Hence a major draw- back of the importance sampling method is the potential to produce results that are arbitrarily in error and with no diagnostic indication. This also highlights a key re- quirement for the sampling distribution q(z), namely that it should not be small or zero in regions where p(z) may be signi\ufb01cant. For distributions de\ufb01ned in terms of a graphical model, we can apply the impor- tance sampling technique in various ways. For discrete variables, a simple approach is called uniform sampling. The joint distribution for a directed graph is de\ufb01ned by (11.4). Each sample from the joint distribution is obtained by \ufb01rst setting those variables zi that are in the evidence set equal to their observed values. Each of the remaining variables is then sampled independently from a uniform distribution over the space of possible instantiations. To determine the corresponding weight associ- ated with a sample z(l), we note that the sampling distribution \u0004q(z) is uniform over the possible choices for z, and that \u0004p(z|x) = \u0004p(z), where x denotes the subset of variables that are observed, and the equality follows from the fact that every sample z that is generated is necessarily consistent with the evidence. Thus the weights rl are simply proportional to p(z). Note that the variables can be sampled in any order. This approach can yield poor results if the posterior distribution is far from uniform, as is often the case in practice. An improvement on this approach is called likelihood weighted sampling (Fung and Chang, 1990; Shachter and Peot, 1990) and is based on ancestral sampling of the variables. For each variable in turn, if that variable is in the evidence set, then it is just set to its instantiated value. If it is not in the evidence set, then it is sampled from the conditional distribution p(zi|pai) in which the conditioning variables are set to their currently sampled values. The weighting associated with the resulting sample z is then given by r(z) = \u000e zi\u0338\u2208e p(zi|pai) p(zi|pai) \u000e zi\u2208e p(zi|pai) 1 = \u000e zi\u2208e p(zi|pai). (11.24) This method can be further extended using self-importance sampling (Shachter and Peot, 1990) in which the importance sampling distribution is continually updated to re\ufb02ect the current estimated posterior distribution. 11.1.5 Sampling-importance-resampling The rejection sampling method discussed in Section 11.1.2 depends in part for its success on the determination of a suitable value for the constant k.

As in the case of rejection sampling, the sampling-importance-resampling (SIR) approach also makes use of a sampling distribution q(z) but avoids having to de- termine the constant k. There are two stages to the scheme. In the \ufb01rst stage, L samples z(1), . . . , z(L) are drawn from q(z). Then in the second stage, weights w1, . . . , wL are constructed using (11.23). Finally, a second set of L samples is drawn from the discrete distribution (z(1), . . . , z(L)) with probabilities given by the weights (w1, . . . , wL). The resulting L samples are only approximately distributed according to p(z), but the distribution becomes correct in the limit L \u2192\u221e.

Taking the limit L \u2192\u221e, and assuming suitable regularity of the dis- tributions, we can replace the sums by integrals weighted according to the original sampling distribution q(z) p(z \u2a7da) = \u0006 I(z \u2a7da) {\u0004p(z)/q(z)} q(z) dz \u0006 {\u0004p(z)/q(z)} q(z) dz = \u0006 I(z \u2a7da)\u0004p(z) dz \u0006 \u0004p(z) dz = \u0006 I(z \u2a7da)p(z) dz (11.26) which is the cumulative distribution function of p(z). Again, we see that the normal- ization of p(z) is not required. For a \ufb01nite value of L, and a given initial sample set, the resampled values will only approximately be drawn from the desired distribution. As with rejection sam- pling, the approximation improves as the sampling distribution q(z) gets closer to the desired distribution p(z). When q(z) = p(z), the initial samples (z(1), . . . , z(L)) have the desired distribution, and the weights wn = 1/L so that the resampled values also have the desired distribution.

(11.27) 11.1.6 Sampling and the EM algorithm In addition to providing a mechanism for direct implementation of the Bayesian framework, Monte Carlo methods can also play a role in the frequentist paradigm, for example to \ufb01nd maximum likelihood solutions. In particular, sampling methods can be used to approximate the E step of the EM algorithm for models in which the E step cannot be performed analytically. Consider a model with hidden variables Z, visible (observed) variables X, and parameters \u03b8. The function that is optimized with respect to \u03b8 in the M step is the expected complete-data log likelihood, given by Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = \u0006 p(Z|X, \u03b8old) ln p(Z, X|\u03b8) dZ. (11.28) We can use sampling methods to approximate this integral by a \ufb01nite sum over sam- ples {Z(l)}, which are drawn from the current estimate for the posterior distribution p(Z|X, \u03b8old), so that Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) \u22431 L L \u0002 l=1 ln p(Z(l), X|\u03b8). (11.29) The Q function is then optimized in the usual way in the M step. This procedure is called the Monte Carlo EM algorithm. It is straightforward to extend this to the problem of \ufb01nding the mode of the posterior distribution over \u03b8 (the MAP estimate) when a prior distribution p(\u03b8) has been de\ufb01ned, simply by adding ln p(\u03b8) to the function Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) before performing the M step. A particular instance of the Monte Carlo EM algorithm, called stochastic EM, arises if we consider a \ufb01nite mixture model, and draw just one sample at each E step. Here the latent variable Z characterizes which of the K components of the mixture is responsible for generating each data point. In the E step, a sample of Z is taken from the posterior distribution p(Z|X, \u03b8old) where X is the data set. This effectively makes a hard assignment of each data point to one of the components in the mixture. In the M step, this sampled approximation to the posterior distribution is used to update the model parameters in the usual way.",

Suppose fur- ther that it is relatively straightforward to sample from the complete-data parameter posterior p(\u03b8|Z, X).

    "text": "538 11. SAMPLING METHODS and which scales well with the dimensionality of the sample space. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have their origins in physics (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949), and it was only towards the end of the 1980s that they started to have a signi\ufb01cant impact in the \ufb01eld of statistics. As with rejection and importance sampling, we again sample from a proposal distribution. This time, however, we maintain a record of the current state z(\u03c4), and the proposal distribution q(z|z(\u03c4)) depends on this current state, and so the sequence of samples z(1), z(2), . . . forms a Markov chain. Again, if we write p(z) = \u0004p(z)/Zp, Section 11.2.1 we will assume that \u0004p(z) can readily be evaluated for any given value of z, although the value of Zp may be unknown. The proposal distribution itself is chosen to be suf\ufb01ciently simple that it is straightforward to draw samples from it directly. At each cycle of the algorithm, we generate a candidate sample z\u22c6from the proposal distribution and then accept the sample according to an appropriate criterion. In the basic Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953), we assume that the proposal distribution is symmetric, that is q(zA|zB) = q(zB|zA) for all values of zA and zB. The candidate sample is then accepted with probability A(z\u22c6, z(\u03c4)) = min \u000f 1, \u0004p(z\u22c6) \u0004p(z(\u03c4)) \u0010 . (11.33) This can be achieved by choosing a random number u with uniform distribution over the unit interval (0, 1) and then accepting the sample if A(z\u22c6, z(\u03c4)) > u. Note that if the step from z(\u03c4) to z\u22c6causes an increase in the value of p(z), then the candidate point is certain to be kept. If the candidate sample is accepted, then z(\u03c4+1) = z\u22c6, otherwise the candidate point z\u22c6is discarded, z(\u03c4+1) is set to z(\u03c4) and another candidate sample is drawn from the distribution q(z|z(\u03c4+1)). This is in contrast to rejection sampling, where re- jected samples are simply discarded. In the Metropolis algorithm when a candidate point is rejected, the previous sample is included instead in the \ufb01nal list of samples, leading to multiple copies of samples. Of course, in a practical implementation, only a single copy of each retained sample would be kept, along with an integer weighting factor recording how many times that state appears. As we shall see, as long as q(zA|zB) is positive for any values of zA and zB (this is a suf\ufb01cient but not necessary condition), the distribution of z(\u03c4) tends to p(z) as \u03c4 \u2192\u221e. It should be emphasized, however, that the sequence z(1), z(2), . . . is not a set of independent samples from p(z) because successive samples are highly correlated. If we wish to obtain independent samples, then we can discard most of the sequence and just re- tain every M th sample. For M suf\ufb01ciently large, the retained samples will for all practical purposes be independent. Figure 11.9 shows a simple illustrative exam- ple of sampling from a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution using the Metropolis algorithm in which the proposal distribution is an isotropic Gaussian. Further insight into the nature of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms can be gleaned by looking at the properties of a speci\ufb01c example, namely a simple random",

If the initial state is z(1) = 0, then by sym- metry the expected state at time \u03c4 will also be zero E[z(\u03c4)] = 0, and similarly it is easily seen that E[(z(\u03c4))2] = \u03c4/2. Thus after \u03c4 steps, the random walk has only trav- Exercise 11.10 elled a distance that on average is proportional to the square root of \u03c4. This square root dependence is typical of random walk behaviour and shows that random walks are very inef\ufb01cient in exploring the state space. As we shall see, a central goal in designing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is to avoid random walk behaviour. 11.2.1 Markov chains Before discussing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in more detail, it is use- ful to study some general properties of Markov chains in more detail. In particular, we ask under what circumstances will a Markov chain converge to the desired dis- tribution. A \ufb01rst-order Markov chain is de\ufb01ned to be a series of random variables z(1), . . . , z(M) such that the following conditional independence property holds for m \u2208{1, . . . , M \u22121} p(z(m+1)|z(1), . . . , z(m)) = p(z(m+1)|z(m)). (11.37) This of course can be represented as a directed graph in the form of a chain, an ex- ample of which is shown in Figure 8.38. We can then specify the Markov chain by giving the probability distribution for the initial variable p(z(0)) together with the",

A Markov chain is called homogeneous if the transition probabilities are the same for all m. The marginal probability for a particular variable can be expressed in terms of the marginal probability for the previous variable in the chain in the form p(z(m+1)) = \u0002 z(m) p(z(m+1)|z(m))p(z(m)). (11.38) A distribution is said to be invariant, or stationary, with respect to a Markov chain if each step in the chain leaves that distribution invariant. Thus, for a homogeneous Markov chain with transition probabilities T(z\u2032, z), the distribution p\u22c6(z) is invariant if p\u22c6(z) = \u0002 z\u2032 T(z\u2032, z)p\u22c6(z\u2032). (11.39) Note that a given Markov chain may have more than one invariant distribution. For instance, if the transition probabilities are given by the identity transformation, then any distribution will be invariant. A suf\ufb01cient (but not necessary) condition for ensuring that the required distribu- tion p(z) is invariant is to choose the transition probabilities to satisfy the property of detailed balance, de\ufb01ned by p\u22c6(z)T(z, z\u2032) = p\u22c6(z\u2032)T(z\u2032, z) (11.40) for the particular distribution p\u22c6(z). It is easily seen that a transition probability that satis\ufb01es detailed balance with respect to a particular distribution will leave that distribution invariant, because \u0002 z\u2032 p\u22c6(z\u2032)T(z\u2032, z) = \u0002 z\u2032 p\u22c6(z)T(z, z\u2032) = p\u22c6(z) \u0002 z\u2032 p(z\u2032|z) = p\u22c6(z). (11.41) A Markov chain that respects detailed balance is said to be reversible. Our goal is to use Markov chains to sample from a given distribution. We can achieve this if we set up a Markov chain such that the desired distribution is invariant. However, we must also require that for m \u2192\u221e, the distribution p(z(m)) converges to the required invariant distribution p\u22c6(z), irrespective of the choice of initial dis- tribution p(z(0)). This property is called ergodicity, and the invariant distribution is then called the equilibrium distribution. Clearly, an ergodic Markov chain can have only one equilibrium distribution. It can be shown that a homogeneous Markov chain will be ergodic, subject only to weak restrictions on the invariant distribution and the transition probabilities (Neal, 1993). In practice we often construct the transition probabilities from a set of \u2018base\u2019 transitions B1, . . . , BK. This can be achieved through a mixture distribution of the form T(z\u2032, z) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03b1kBk(z\u2032, z) (11.42)",

For the case of the mixture (11.42), if each of the base transitions sat- is\ufb01es detailed balance, then the mixture transition T will also satisfy detailed bal- ance. This does not hold for the transition probability constructed using (11.43), al- though by symmetrizing the order of application of the base transitions, in the form B1, B2, . . . , BK, BK, . . . , B2, B1, detailed balance can be restored. A common ex- ample of the use of composite transition probabilities is where each base transition changes only a subset of the variables. 11.2.2 The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm Earlier we introduced the basic Metropolis algorithm, without actually demon- strating that it samples from the required distribution. Before giving a proof, we \ufb01rst discuss a generalization, known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hast- ings, 1970), to the case where the proposal distribution is no longer a symmetric function of its arguments. In particular at step \u03c4 of the algorithm, in which the cur- rent state is z(\u03c4), we draw a sample z\u22c6from the distribution qk(z|z(\u03c4)) and then accept it with probability Ak(z\u22c6, z\u03c4) where Ak(z\u22c6, z(\u03c4)) = min \u000f 1, \u0004p(z\u22c6)qk(z(\u03c4)|z\u22c6) \u0004p(z(\u03c4))qk(z\u22c6|z(\u03c4)) \u0010 . (11.44) Here k labels the members of the set of possible transitions being considered. Again, the evaluation of the acceptance criterion does not require knowledge of the normal- izing constant Zp in the probability distribution p(z) = \u0004p(z)/Zp. For a symmetric proposal distribution the Metropolis-Hastings criterion (11.44) reduces to the stan- dard Metropolis criterion given by (11.33). We can show that p(z) is an invariant distribution of the Markov chain de\ufb01ned by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by showing that detailed balance, de\ufb01ned by (11.40), is satis\ufb01ed. Using (11.44) we have p(z)qk(z|z\u2032)Ak(z\u2032, z) = min (p(z)qk(z|z\u2032), p(z\u2032)qk(z\u2032|z)) = min (p(z\u2032)qk(z\u2032|z), p(z)qk(z|z\u2032)) = p(z\u2032)qk(z\u2032|z)Ak(z, z\u2032) (11.45) as required. The speci\ufb01c choice of proposal distribution can have a marked effect on the performance of the algorithm. For continuous state spaces, a common choice is a Gaussian centred on the current state, leading to an important trade-off in determin- ing the variance parameter of this distribution.

SAMPLING METHODS Figure 11.10 Schematic illustration of the use of an isotropic Gaussian proposal distribution (blue circle) to sample from a correlated multivariate Gaussian distribution (red ellipse) having very different stan- dard deviations in different directions, using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In order to keep the rejection rate low, the scale \u03c1 of the proposal distribution should be on the order of the smallest standard deviation \u03c3min, which leads to random walk behaviour in which the number of steps sep- arating states that are approximately independent is of order (\u03c3max/\u03c3min)2 where \u03c3max is the largest standard deviation. \u03c3max \u03c3min \u03c1 proportion of accepted transitions will be high, but progress through the state space takes the form of a slow random walk leading to long correlation times. However, if the variance parameter is large, then the rejection rate will be high because, in the kind of complex problems we are considering, many of the proposed steps will be to states for which the probability p(z) is low. Consider a multivariate distribution p(z) having strong correlations between the components of z, as illustrated in Fig- ure 11.10. The scale \u03c1 of the proposal distribution should be as large as possible without incurring high rejection rates. This suggests that \u03c1 should be of the same order as the smallest length scale \u03c3min. The system then explores the distribution along the more extended direction by means of a random walk, and so the number of steps to arrive at a state that is more or less independent of the original state is of order (\u03c3max/\u03c3min)2. In fact in two dimensions, the increase in rejection rate as \u03c1 increases is offset by the larger steps sizes of those transitions that are accepted, and more generally for a multivariate Gaussian the number of steps required to obtain independent samples scales like (\u03c3max/\u03c32)2 where \u03c32 is the second-smallest stan- dard deviation (Neal, 1993). These details aside, it remains the case that if the length scales over which the distributions vary are very different in different directions, then the Metropolis Hastings algorithm can have very slow convergence. 11.3. Gibbs Sampling Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984) is a simple and widely applicable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and can be seen as a special case of the Metropolis- Hastings algorithm. Consider the distribution p(z) = p(z1, . . . , zM) from which we wish to sample, and suppose that we have chosen some initial state for the Markov chain. Each step of the Gibbs sampling procedure involves replacing the value of one of the variables by a value drawn from the distribution of that variable conditioned on the values of the remaining variables. Thus we replace zi by a value drawn from the distribution p(zi|z\\i), where zi denotes the ith component of z, and z\\i denotes z1, . . . , zM but with zi omitted.

SAMPLING METHODS To show that this procedure samples from the required distribution, we \ufb01rst of all note that the distribution p(z) is an invariant of each of the Gibbs sampling steps individually and hence of the whole Markov chain. This follows from the fact that when we sample from p(zi|{z\\i), the marginal distribution p(z\\i) is clearly invariant because the value of z\\i is unchanged. Also, each step by de\ufb01nition samples from the correct conditional distribution p(zi|z\\i). Because these conditional and marginal distributions together specify the joint distribution, we see that the joint distribution is itself invariant. The second requirement to be satis\ufb01ed in order that the Gibbs sampling proce- dure samples from the correct distribution is that it be ergodic. A suf\ufb01cient condition for ergodicity is that none of the conditional distributions be anywhere zero. If this is the case, then any point in z space can be reached from any other point in a \ufb01nite number of steps involving one update of each of the component variables. If this requirement is not satis\ufb01ed, so that some of the conditional distributions have zeros, then ergodicity, if it applies, must be proven explicitly. The distribution of initial states must also be speci\ufb01ed in order to complete the algorithm, although samples drawn after many iterations will effectively become independent of this distribution. Of course, successive samples from the Markov chain will be highly correlated, and so to obtain samples that are nearly independent it will be necessary to subsample the sequence. We can obtain the Gibbs sampling procedure as a particular instance of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as follows. Consider a Metropolis-Hastings sampling step involving the variable zk in which the remaining variables z\\k remain \ufb01xed, and for which the transition probability from z to z\u22c6is given by qk(z\u22c6|z) = p(z\u22c6 k|z\\k). We note that z\u22c6 \\k = z\\k because these components are unchanged by the sampling step. Also, p(z) = p(zk|z\\k)p(z\\k). Thus the factor that determines the acceptance probability in the Metropolis-Hastings (11.44) is given by A(z\u22c6, z) = p(z\u22c6)qk(z|z\u22c6) p(z)qk(z\u22c6|z) = p(z\u22c6 k|z\u22c6 \\k)p(z\u22c6 \\k)p(zk|z\u22c6 \\k) p(zk|z\\k)p(z\\k)p(z\u22c6 k|z\\k) = 1 (11.49) where we have used z\u22c6 \\k = z\\k. Thus the Metropolis-Hastings steps are always accepted. As with the Metropolis algorithm, we can gain some insight into the behaviour of Gibbs sampling by investigating its application to a Gaussian distribution. Consider a correlated Gaussian in two variables, as illustrated in Figure 11.11, having con- ditional distributions of width l and marginal distributions of width L. The typical step size is governed by the conditional distributions and will be of order l. Because the state evolves according to a random walk, the number of steps needed to obtain independent samples from the distribution will be of order (L/l)2. Of course if the Gaussian distribution were uncorrelated, then the Gibbs sampling procedure would be optimally ef\ufb01cient. For this simple problem, we could rotate the coordinate sys- tem in order to decorrelate the variables. However, in practical applications it will generally be infeasible to \ufb01nd such transformations. One approach to reducing random walk behaviour in Gibbs sampling is called over-relaxation (Adler, 1981). In its original form, this applies to problems for which",

The step size is governed by the stan- dard deviation of the conditional distri- bution (green curve), and is O(l), lead- ing to slow progress in the direction of elongation of the joint distribution (red ellipse). The number of steps needed to obtain an independent sample from the distribution is O((L/l)2). z1 z2 L l the conditional distributions are Gaussian, which represents a more general class of distributions than the multivariate Gaussian because, for example, the non-Gaussian distribution p(z, y) \u221dexp(\u2212z2y2) has Gaussian conditional distributions. At each step of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, the conditional distribution for a particular component zi has some mean \u00b5i and some variance \u03c32 i . In the over-relaxation frame- work, the value of zi is replaced with z\u2032 i = \u00b5i + \u03b1(zi \u2212\u00b5i) + \u03c3i(1 \u2212\u03b12 i)1/2\u03bd (11.50) where \u03bd is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, and \u03b1 is a parameter such that \u22121 < \u03b1 < 1. For \u03b1 = 0, the method is equivalent to standard Gibbs sampling, and for \u03b1 < 0 the step is biased to the opposite side of the mean. This step leaves the desired distribution invariant because if zi has mean \u00b5i and variance \u03c32 i , then so too does z\u2032 i. The effect of over-relaxation is to encourage directed motion through state space when the variables are highly correlated. The framework of ordered over-relaxation (Neal, 1999) generalizes this approach to non- Gaussian distributions. The practical applicability of Gibbs sampling depends on the ease with which samples can be drawn from the conditional distributions p(zk|z\\k). In the case of probability distributions speci\ufb01ed using graphical models, the conditional distribu- tions for individual nodes depend only on the variables in the corresponding Markov blankets, as illustrated in Figure 11.12. For directed graphs, a wide choice of condi- tional distributions for the individual nodes conditioned on their parents will lead to conditional distributions for Gibbs sampling that are log concave. The adaptive re- jection sampling methods discussed in Section 11.1.3 therefore provide a framework for Monte Carlo sampling from directed graphs with broad applicability. If the graph is constructed using distributions from the exponential family, and if the parent-child relationships preserve conjugacy, then the full conditional distri- butions arising in Gibbs sampling will have the same functional form as the orig-",

For graphical models, this conditional distribution is a function only of the states of the nodes in the Markov blanket. For an undirected graph this com- prises the set of neighbours, as shown on the left, while for a directed graph the Markov blanket comprises the parents, the children, and the co-parents, as shown on the right. inal conditional distributions (conditioned on the parents) de\ufb01ning each node, and so standard sampling techniques can be employed. In general, the full conditional distributions will be of a complex form that does not permit the use of standard sam- pling algorithms. However, if these conditionals are log concave, then sampling can be done ef\ufb01ciently using adaptive rejection sampling (assuming the corresponding variable is a scalar). If, at each stage of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, instead of drawing a sample from the corresponding conditional distribution, we make a point estimate of the variable given by the maximum of the conditional distribution, then we obtain the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm discussed in Section 8.3.3. Thus ICM can be seen as a greedy approximation to Gibbs sampling. Because the basic Gibbs sampling technique considers one variable at a time, there are strong dependencies between successive samples. At the opposite extreme, if we could draw samples directly from the joint distribution (an operation that we are supposing is intractable), then successive samples would be independent. We can hope to improve on the simple Gibbs sampler by adopting an intermediate strategy in which we sample successively from groups of variables rather than individual vari- ables. This is achieved in the blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm by choosing blocks of variables, not necessarily disjoint, and then sampling jointly from the variables in each block in turn, conditioned on the remaining variables (Jensen et al., 1995). 11.4. Slice Sampling We have seen that one of the dif\ufb01culties with the Metropolis algorithm is the sensi- tivity to step size. If this is too small, the result is slow decorrelation due to random walk behaviour, whereas if it is too large the result is inef\ufb01ciency due to a high rejec- tion rate. The technique of slice sampling (Neal, 2003) provides an adaptive step size that is automatically adjusted to match the characteristics of the distribution. Again it requires that we are able to evaluate the unnormalized distribution \u0004p(z). Consider \ufb01rst the univariate case. Slice sampling involves augmenting z with an additional variable u and then drawing samples from the joint (z, u) space. We shall see another example of this approach when we discuss hybrid Monte Carlo in Section 11.5. The goal is to sample uniformly from the area under the distribution",

This can be achieved by alternately sampling z and u. Given the value of z we evaluate \u0004p(z) and then sample u uniformly in the range 0 \u2a7du \u2a7d\u0004p(z), which is straightforward.

The next value of z is obtained by considering a region zmin \u2a7dz \u2a7dzmax that contains z(\u03c4). It is in the choice of this region that the adap- tation to the characteristic length scales of the distribution takes place. We want the region to encompass as much of the slice as possible so as to allow large moves in z space while having as little as possible of this region lying outside the slice, because this makes the sampling less ef\ufb01cient. One approach to the choice of region involves starting with a region containing z(\u03c4) having some width w and then testing each of the end points to see if they lie within the slice. If either end point does not, then the region is extended in that direction by increments of value w until the end point lies outside the region. A candidate value z\u2032 is then chosen uniformly from this region, and if it lies within the slice, then it forms z(\u03c4+1).

This requires that we are able to compute, for each component zi, a function that is proportional to p(zi|z\\i). 11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm As we have already noted, one of the major limitations of the Metropolis algorithm is that it can exhibit random walk behaviour whereby the distance traversed through the state space grows only as the square root of the number of steps. The problem cannot be resolved simply by taking bigger steps as this leads to a high rejection rate. In this section, we introduce a more sophisticated class of transitions based on an analogy with physical systems and that has the property of being able to make large changes to the system state while keeping the rejection probability small. It is ap- plicable to distributions over continuous variables for which we can readily evaluate the gradient of the log probability with respect to the state variables. We will discuss the dynamical systems framework in Section 11.5.1, and then in Section 11.5.2 we explain how this may be combined with the Metropolis algorithm to yield the pow- erful hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. A background in physics is not required as this section is self-contained and the key results are all derived from \ufb01rst principles. 11.5.1 Dynamical systems The dynamical approach to stochastic sampling has its origins in algorithms for simulating the behaviour of physical systems evolving under Hamiltonian dynam- ics. In a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, the goal is to sample from a given probability distribution p(z). The framework of Hamiltonian dynamics is exploited by casting the probabilistic simulation in the form of a Hamiltonian system. In order to remain in keeping with the literature in this area, we make use of the relevant dynamical systems terminology where appropriate, which will be de\ufb01ned as we go along. The dynamics that we consider corresponds to the evolution of the state variable z = {zi} under continuous time, which we denote by \u03c4. Classical dynamics is de- scribed by Newton\u2019s second law of motion in which the acceleration of an object is proportional to the applied force, corresponding to a second-order differential equa- tion over time. We can decompose a second-order equation into two coupled \ufb01rst- order equations by introducing intermediate momentum variables r, corresponding to the rate of change of the state variables z, having components ri = dzi d\u03c4 (11.53) where the zi can be regarded as position variables in this dynamics perspective.

The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm 549 for each position variable there is a corresponding momentum variable, and the joint space of position and momentum variables is called phase space. Without loss of generality, we can write the probability distribution p(z) in the form p(z) = 1 Zp exp (\u2212E(z)) (11.54) where E(z) is interpreted as the potential energy of the system when in state z. The system acceleration is the rate of change of momentum and is given by the applied force, which itself is the negative gradient of the potential energy dri d\u03c4 = \u2212\u2202E(z) \u2202zi . (11.55) It is convenient to reformulate this dynamical system using the Hamiltonian framework. To do this, we \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the kinetic energy by K(r) = 1 2\u2225r\u22252 = 1 2 \u0002 i r2 i . (11.56) The total energy of the system is then the sum of its potential and kinetic energies H(z, r) = E(z) + K(r) (11.57) where H is the Hamiltonian function. Using (11.53), (11.55), (11.56), and (11.57), we can now express the dynamics of the system in terms of the Hamiltonian equa- tions given by Exercise 11.15 dzi d\u03c4 = \u2202H \u2202ri (11.58) dri d\u03c4 = \u2212\u2202H \u2202zi .

One of Hamilton\u2019s most important contributions was a new formulation of dynamics, which played a signi\ufb01cant role in the later development of quantum mechanics. His other great achievement was the development of quaternions, which generalize the concept of complex numbers by introducing three distinct square roots of minus one, which satisfy i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = \u22121. It is said that these equations occurred to him while walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin with his wife, on 16 October 1843, and he promptly carved the equations into the side of Broome bridge. Although there is no longer any evidence of the carving, there is now a stone plaque on the bridge commemorating the discovery and displaying the quaternion equations.",

(11.60) A second important property of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, known as Li- ouville\u2019s Theorem, is that they preserve volume in phase space. In other words, if we consider a region within the space of variables (z, r), then as this region evolves under the equations of Hamiltonian dynamics, its shape may change but its volume will not. This can be seen by noting that the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld (rate of change of location in phase space) is given by V = \u000f dz d\u03c4 , dr d\u03c4 \u0010 (11.61) and that the divergence of this \ufb01eld vanishes div V = \u0002 i \u2202 \u2202zi dzi d\u03c4 + \u2202 \u2202ri dri d\u03c4 = \u0002 i \u2212\u2202 \u2202zi \u2202H \u2202ri + \u2202 \u2202ri \u2202H \u2202zi = 0. (11.62) Now consider the joint distribution over phase space whose total energy is the Hamiltonian, i.e., the distribution given by p(z, r) = 1 ZH exp(\u2212H(z, r)). (11.63) Using the two results of conservation of volume and conservation of H, it follows that the Hamiltonian dynamics will leave p(z, r) invariant. This can be seen by considering a small region of phase space over which H is approximately constant. If we follow the evolution of the Hamiltonian equations for a \ufb01nite time, then the volume of this region will remain unchanged as will the value of H in this region, and hence the probability density, which is a function only of H, will also be unchanged. Although H is invariant, the values of z and r will vary, and so by integrating the Hamiltonian dynamics over a \ufb01nite time duration it becomes possible to make large changes to z in a systematic way that avoids random walk behaviour. Evolution under the Hamiltonian dynamics will not, however, sample ergodi- cally from p(z, r) because the value of H is constant. In order to arrive at an ergodic sampling scheme, we can introduce additional moves in phase space that change the value of H while also leaving the distribution p(z, r) invariant. The simplest way to achieve this is to replace the value of r with one drawn from its distribution conditioned on z. This can be regarded as a Gibbs sampling step, and hence from",

    "text": "11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm 551 Section 11.3 we see that this also leaves the desired distribution invariant. Noting that z and r are independent in the distribution p(z, r), we see that the conditional distribution p(r|z) is a Gaussian from which it is straightforward to sample. Exercise 11.16 In a practical application of this approach, we have to address the problem of performing a numerical integration of the Hamiltonian equations. This will neces- sarily introduce numerical errors and so we should devise a scheme that minimizes the impact of such errors. In fact, it turns out that integration schemes can be devised for which Liouville\u2019s theorem still holds exactly. This property will be important in the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, which is discussed in Section 11.5.2. One scheme for achieving this is called the leapfrog discretization and involves alternately updat- ing discrete-time approximations \u0001z and \u0001r to the position and momentum variables using \u0001ri(\u03c4 + \u03f5/2) = \u0001ri(\u03c4) \u2212\u03f5 2 \u2202E \u2202zi (\u0001z(\u03c4)) (11.64) \u0001zi(\u03c4 + \u03f5) = \u0001zi(\u03c4) + \u03f5\u0001ri(\u03c4 + \u03f5/2) (11.65) \u0001ri(\u03c4 + \u03f5) = \u0001ri(\u03c4 + \u03f5/2) \u2212\u03f5 2 \u2202E \u2202zi (\u0001z(\u03c4 + \u03f5)). (11.66) We see that this takes the form of a half-step update of the momentum variables with step size \u03f5/2, followed by a full-step update of the position variables with step size \u03f5, followed by a second half-step update of the momentum variables. If several leapfrog steps are applied in succession, it can be seen that half-step updates to the momentum variables can be combined into full-step updates with step size \u03f5. The successive updates to position and momentum variables then leapfrog over each other. In order to advance the dynamics by a time interval \u03c4, we need to take \u03c4/\u03f5 steps. The error involved in the discretized approximation to the continuous time dynamics will go to zero, assuming a smooth function E(z), in the limit \u03f5 \u21920. However, for a nonzero \u03f5 as used in practice, some residual error will remain. We shall see in Section 11.5.2 how the effects of such errors can be eliminated in the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. In summary then, the Hamiltonian dynamical approach involves alternating be- tween a series of leapfrog updates and a resampling of the momentum variables from their marginal distribution. Note that the Hamiltonian dynamics method, unlike the basic Metropolis algo- rithm, is able to make use of information about the gradient of the log probability distribution as well as about the distribution itself. An analogous situation is familiar from the domain of function optimization. In most cases where gradient informa- tion is available, it is highly advantageous to make use of it. Informally, this follows from the fact that in a space of dimension D, the additional computational cost of evaluating a gradient compared with evaluating the function itself will typically be a \ufb01xed factor independent of D, whereas the D-dimensional gradient vector conveys D pieces of information compared with the one piece of information given by the function itself.",

SAMPLING METHODS 11.5.2 Hybrid Monte Carlo As we discussed in the previous section, for a nonzero step size \u03f5, the discretiza- tion of the leapfrog algorithm will introduce errors into the integration of the Hamil- tonian dynamical equations. Hybrid Monte Carlo (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 1996) combines Hamiltonian dynamics with the Metropolis algorithm and thereby removes any bias associated with the discretization. Speci\ufb01cally, the algorithm uses a Markov chain consisting of alternate stochastic updates of the momentum variable r and Hamiltonian dynamical updates using the leapfrog algorithm. After each application of the leapfrog algorithm, the resulting candidate state is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion based on the value of the Hamiltonian H. Thus if (z, r) is the initial state and (z\u22c6, r\u22c6) is the state after the leapfrog integration, then this candidate state is accepted with probability min (1, exp{H(z, r) \u2212H(z\u22c6, r\u22c6)}) . (11.67) If the leapfrog integration were to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics perfectly, then every such candidate step would automatically be accepted because the value of H would be unchanged. Due to numerical errors, the value of H may sometimes decrease, and we would like the Metropolis criterion to remove any bias due to this effect and ensure that the resulting samples are indeed drawn from the required dis- tribution. In order for this to be the case, we need to ensure that the update equations corresponding to the leapfrog integration satisfy detailed balance (11.40). This is easily achieved by modifying the leapfrog scheme as follows. Before the start of each leapfrog integration sequence, we choose at random, with equal probability, whether to integrate forwards in time (using step size \u03f5) or backwards in time (using step size \u2212\u03f5). We \ufb01rst note that the leapfrog integration scheme (11.64), (11.65), and (11.66) is time-reversible, so that integration for L steps using step size \u2212\u03f5 will exactly undo the effect of integration for L steps using step size \u03f5. Next we show that the leapfrog integration preserves phase-space volume exactly. This follows from the fact that each step in the leapfrog scheme updates either a zi variable or an ri variable by an amount that is a function only of the other variable. As shown in Figure 11.14, this has the effect of shearing a region of phase space while not altering its volume. Finally, we use these results to show that detailed balance holds. Consider a small region R of phase space that, under a sequence of L leapfrog iterations of step size \u03f5, maps to a region R\u2032. Using conservation of volume under the leapfrog iteration, we see that if R has volume \u03b4V then so too will R\u2032. If we choose an initial point from the distribution (11.63) and then update it using L leapfrog interactions, the probability of the transition going from R to R\u2032 is given by 1 ZH exp(\u2212H(R))\u03b4V 1 2 min {1, exp(\u2212H(R) + H(R\u2032))} .

Note that this proof ignores any overlap between the regions Exercise 11.17 R and R\u2032 but is easily generalized to allow for such overlap. It is not dif\ufb01cult to construct examples for which the leapfrog algorithm returns to its starting position after a \ufb01nite number of iterations. In such cases, the random replacement of the momentum values before each leapfrog integration will not be suf\ufb01cient to ensure ergodicity because the position variables will never be updated. Such phenomena are easily avoided by choosing the magnitude of the step size at random from some small interval, before each leapfrog integration. We can gain some insight into the behaviour of the hybrid Monte Carlo algo- rithm by considering its application to a multivariate Gaussian. For convenience, consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) with independent components, for which the Hamiltonian is given by H(z, r) = 1 2 \u0002 i 1 \u03c32 i z2 i + 1 2 \u0002 i r2 i . (11.70) Our conclusions will be equally valid for a Gaussian distribution having correlated components because the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm exhibits rotational isotropy. During the leapfrog integration, each pair of phase-space variables zi, ri evolves in- dependently. However, the acceptance or rejection of the candidate point is based on the value of H, which depends on the values of all of the variables. Thus, a signi\ufb01cant integration error in any one of the variables could lead to a high prob- ability of rejection. In order that the discrete leapfrog integration be a reasonably",

This is governed by the smallest value of \u03c3i, which we denote by \u03c3min. Recall that the goal of the leapfrog integration in hybrid Monte Carlo is to move a substantial distance through phase space to a new state that is relatively independent of the initial state and still achieve a high probability of acceptance. In order to achieve this, the leapfrog integration must be continued for a number of iterations of order \u03c3max/\u03c3min. By contrast, consider the behaviour of a simple Metropolis algorithm with an isotropic Gaussian proposal distribution of variance s2, considered earlier. In order to avoid high rejection rates, the value of s must be of order \u03c3min. The exploration of state space then proceeds by a random walk and takes of order (\u03c3max/\u03c3min)2 steps to arrive at a roughly independent state. 11.6. Estimating the Partition Function As we have seen, most of the sampling algorithms considered in this chapter re- quire only the functional form of the probability distribution up to a multiplicative constant. Thus if we write pE(z) = 1 ZE exp(\u2212E(z)) (11.71) then the value of the normalization constant ZE, also known as the partition func- tion, is not needed in order to draw samples from p(z). However, knowledge of the value of ZE can be useful for Bayesian model comparison since it represents the model evidence (i.e., the probability of the observed data given the model), and so it is of interest to consider how its value might be obtained. We assume that direct evaluation by summing, or integrating, the function exp(\u2212E(z)) over the state space of z is intractable. For model comparison, it is actually the ratio of the partition functions for two models that is required. Multiplication of this ratio by the ratio of prior probabilities gives the ratio of posterior probabilities, which can then be used for model selection or model averaging. One way to estimate a ratio of partition functions is to use importance sampling from a distribution with energy function G(z) ZE ZG = \u0005 z exp(\u2212E(z)) \u0005 z exp(\u2212G(z)) = \u0005 z exp(\u2212E(z) + G(z)) exp(\u2212G(z)) \u0005 z exp(\u2212G(z)) = EG(z)[exp(\u2212E + G)] \u2243 \u0002 l exp(\u2212E(z(l)) + G(z(l))) (11.72)",

If the dis- tribution pG is one for which the partition function can be evaluated analytically, for example a Gaussian, then the absolute value of ZE can be obtained. This approach will only yield accurate results if the importance sampling distri- bution pG is closely matched to the distribution pE, so that the ratio pE/pG does not have wide variations. In practice, suitable analytically speci\ufb01ed importance sampling distributions cannot readily be found for the kinds of complex models considered in this book. An alternative approach is therefore to use the samples obtained from a Markov chain to de\ufb01ne the importance-sampling distribution. If the transition probability for the Markov chain is given by T(z, z\u2032), and the sample set is given by z(1), . . . , z(L), then the sampling distribution can be written as 1 ZG exp (\u2212G(z)) = L \u0002 l=1 T(z(l), z) (11.73) which can be used directly in (11.72). Methods for estimating the ratio of two partition functions require for their suc- cess that the two corresponding distributions be reasonably closely matched. This is especially problematic if we wish to \ufb01nd the absolute value of the partition function for a complex distribution because it is only for relatively simple distributions that the partition function can be evaluated directly, and so attempting to estimate the ratio of partition functions directly is unlikely to be successful. This problem can be tackled using a technique known as chaining (Neal, 1993; Barber and Bishop, 1997), which involves introducing a succession of intermediate distributions p2, . . . , pM\u22121 that interpolate between a simple distribution p1(z) for which we can evaluate the normalization coef\ufb01cient Z1 and the desired complex distribution pM(z). We then have ZM Z1 = Z2 Z1 Z3 Z2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ZM ZM\u22121 (11.74) in which the intermediate ratios can be determined using Monte Carlo methods as discussed above. One way to construct such a sequence of intermediate systems is to use an energy function containing a continuous parameter 0 \u2a7d\u03b1 \u2a7d1 that interpolates between the two distributions E\u03b1(z) = (1 \u2212\u03b1)E1(z) + \u03b1EM(z). (11.75) If the intermediate ratios in (11.74) are to be found using Monte Carlo, it may be more ef\ufb01cient to use a single Markov chain run than to restart the Markov chain for each ratio. In this case, the Markov chain is run initially for the system p1 and then after some suitable number of steps moves on to the next distribution in the sequence. Note, however, that the system must remain close to the equilibrium distribution at each stage.",

We now explore models in which some, or all, of the latent variables are continuous. An important motivation for such models is that many data sets have the property that the data points all lie close to a manifold of much lower dimensionality than that of the original data space. To see why this might arise, consider an artificial data set constructed by taking one of the off-line digits, represented by a 64 x 64 pixel grey-level image, and embedding it in a larger image of size 100 x 100 by padding with pixels having the value zero (corresponding to white pixels) in which the location and orientation of the digit is varied at random, as illustrated in Figure 12.1. Each of the resulting images is represented by a point in the 100 x 100 = 10, OOO-dimensional data space. However, across a data set of such images, there are only three degrees offreedom of variability, corresponding to the vertical and horizontal translations and the rotations.

This is easily shown using proof by induction. To summarize, principal component analysis involves evaluating the mean x and the covariance matrix S of the data set and then finding the M eigenvectors of S corresponding to the M largest eigenvalues. Algorithms for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues, as well as additional theorems related to eigenvector decomposition, can be found in Golub and Van Loan (1996). Note that the computational cost of computing the full eigenvector decomposition for a matrix of size D x Dis O(D3). If we plan to project our data onto the first M principal components, then we only need to find the first M eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This can be done with more efficient techniques, such as the power method (Golub and Van Loan, 1996), that scale like O(MD 2 ), or alternatively we can make use of the EM algorithm. 12.1.2 Minimum-error formulation We now discuss an alternative formulation of peA based on projection error minimization. To do this, we introduce a complete orthonormal set of D-dimensional basis vectors {Ui} where i = 1, ... , D that satisfy (12.7) Because this basis is complete, each data point can be represented exactly by a linear combination of the basis vectors D X n = Laniui i=l (12.8) where the coefficients ani will be different for different data points. This simply corresponds to a rotation of the coordinate system to a new system defined by the {Ui}, and the original D components {Xnl' ... , XnD} are replaced by an equivalent set {anl' ... ,anD}. Taking the inner product with Uj, and making use of the or- thonormality property, we obtain anj = x;Uj, and so without loss of generality we can write D X n = L (X~Ui) Ui\u00b7 i=l (12.9) (12.10) Our goal, however, is to approximate this data point using a representation in- volving a restricted number M < D of variables corresponding to a projection onto a lower-dimensional subspace.

This is to be expected because the projected points xn must lie within the principal subspace, but we can move them freely within that subspace, and so the minimum error is given by the orthogonal projection.

Using a Lagrange multiplier A2 to enforce the constraint, we consider the minimization of (12.16) (12.18) Exercise 12.2 Appendix A Setting the derivative with respect to U2 to zero, we obtain SU2 = A2U2 so that U2 is an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue A2. Thus any eigenvector will define a sta- tionary point of the distortion measure. To find the value of J at the minimum, we back-substitute the solution for U2 into the distortion measure to give J = A2. We therefore obtain the minimum value of J by choosing U2 to be the eigenvector corre- sponding to the smaller of the two eigenvalues. Thus we should choose the principal subspace to be aligned with the eigenvector having the larger eigenvalue. This result accords with our intuition that, in order to minimize the average squared projection distance, we should choose the principal component subspace to pass through the mean of the data points and to be aligned with the directions of maximum variance. For the case when the eigenvalues are equal, any choice of principal direction will give rise to the same value of J. The general solution to the minimization of J for arbitrary D and arbitrary M < D is obtained by choosing the {Ui} to be eigenvectors of the covariance matrix given by SUi = AiUi (12.17) where i = 1, ... ,D, and as usual the eigenvectors {Ui} are chosen to be orthonor- mal. The corresponding value of the distortion measure is then given by D J= L Ai i=M+l which is simply the sum of the eigenvalues of those eigenvectors that are orthogonal to the principal subspace. We therefore obtain the minimum value of J by selecting these eigenvectors to be those having the D - M smallest eigenvalues, and hence the eigenvectors defining the principal subspace are those corresponding to the M largest eigenvalues. Although we have considered M < D, the PCA analysis still holds if M = D, in which case there is no dimensionality reduction but simply a rotation of the coordinate axes to align with principal components. Finally, it is worth noting that there exists a closely related linear dimensionality reduction technique called canonical correlation analysis, or CCA (Hotelling, 1936; Bach and Jordan, 2002). Whereas PCA works with a single random variable, CCA considers two (or more) variables and tries to find a corresponding pair of linear subspaces that have high cross-correlation, so that each component within one of the subspaces is correlated with a single component from the other subspace. Its solution can be expressed in terms of a generalized eigenvector problem. 12.1.3 Applications of peA We can illustrate the use of PCA for data compression by considering the off- line digits data set.

Thus we can solve the eigenvector problem in spaces of lower dimensionality with computational cost O(N3 ) instead of O(D3 ). In order to determine the eigenvectors, we multiply both sides of (12.28) by X T to give ( 1 T) T T NX X (X Vi) = Ai(X Vi) (12.29) from which we see that (XTVi) is an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue Ai.

This formulation of PCA as a probabilistic model was proposed independently by Tipping and Bishop (1997, 1999b) and by Roweis (1998). As we shall see later, it is closely related to factor analysis (Basilevsky, 1994). Probabilistic PCA is a simple example of the linear-Gaussian framework, in which all of the marginal and conditional distributions are Gaussian. We can formu- late probabilistic PCA by first introducing an explicit latent variable z corresponding to the principal-component subspace. Next we define a Gaussian prior distribution p(z) over the latent variable, together with a Gaussian conditional distribution p(xlz) for the observed variable x conditioned on the value of the latent variable. Specifi- cally, the prior distribution over z is given by a zero-mean unit-covariance Gaussian p(z) = N(zIO, I). (12.31) Similarly, the conditional distribution of the observed variable x, conditioned on the value of the latent variable z, is again Gaussian, of the form p(xlz) = N(xlWz + J-L, a 2I) (12.32) Section 8.2.2 in which the mean of x is a general linear function of z governed by the D x M matrix Wand the D-dimensional vector J-L. Note that this factorizes with respect to the elements of x, in other words this is an example of the naive Bayes model.

Intuitively, we can think of the distribution p(x) as being defined by taking an isotropic Gaussian 'spray can' and moving it across the principal subspace spraying Gaussian ink with density determined by 0-2 and weighted by the prior distribution. The accumulated ink density gives rise to a 'pancake' shaped distribution represent- ing the marginal density p(x). The predictive distribution p(x) is governed by the parameters JL, W, and 0-2 \u2022 However, there is redundancy in this parameterization corresponding to rotations of the latent space coordinates. To see this, consider a matrix W = WR where R is an orthogonal matrix. Using the orthogonality property RRT = I, we see that the quantity WWT that appears in the covariance matrix C takes the form (12.39) (12.41) Exercise 12.8 and hence is independent of R. Thus there is a whole family of matrices W all of which give rise to the same predictive distribution. This invariance can be understood in terms of rotations within the latent space. We shall return to a discussion of the number of independent parameters in this model later. When we evaluate the predictive distribution, we require C- 1, which involves the inversion of a D x D matrix. The computation required to do this can be reduced by making use of the matrix inversion identity (C.7) to give C- 1 = 0-- 11 - 0--2WM- 1W T (12.40) where the M x M matrix M is defined by M = WTW + 0-21. Because we invert M rather than inverting C directly, the cost of evaluating C- 1 is reduced from O(D3 ) to O(M3 ). As well as the predictive distribution p(x), we will also require the posterior distributionp(zlx), which can again be written down directly using the result (2.116) for linear-Gaussian models to give (12.42) Note that the posterior mean depends on x, whereas the posterior covariance is in- dependent of x.",

Because the log likelihood is a quadratic function of JL, this solution represents the unique maximum, as can be confirmed by computing second derivatives. Maximization with respect to W and 0'2 is more complex but nonetheless has an exact closed-form solution. It was shown by Tipping and Bishop (1999b) that all of the stationary points of the log likelihood function can be written as (12.45) where U M is a D x M matrix whose columns are given by any subset (of size M) of the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S, the M x M diagonal matrix L M has elements given by the corresponding eigenvalues ..\\, and R is an arbitrary M x M orthogonal matrix. Furthermore, Tipping and Bishop (1999b) showed that the maximum of the like- lihood function is obtained when the M eigenvectors are chosen to be those whose eigenvalues are the M largest (all other solutions being saddle points).

Probabilistic peA 575 Again, we shall assume that the eigenvectors have been arranged in order of decreas- ing values of the corresponding eigenvalues, so that the M principal eigenvectors are Ul,\"\" UM. In this case, the columns of W define the principal subspace of stan- dard PCA. The corresponding maximum likelihood solution for (J'2 is then given by 1 D (J'~L = D-M L Ai i=M+l (12.46) Section 12.2.2 so that (J'~L is the average variance associated with the discarded dimensions. Because R is orthogonal, it can be interpreted as a rotation matrix in the M x M latent space. If we substitute the solution for W into the expression for C, and make use of the orthogonality property RRT = I, we see that C is independent of R. This simply says that the predictive density is unchanged by rotations in the latent space as discussed earlier. For the particular case of R = I, we see that the columns of W are the principal component eigenvectors scaled by the variance parameters Ai - (J'2. The interpretation of these scaling factors is clear once we recognize that for a convolution of independent Gaussian distributions (in this case the latent space distribution and the noise model) the variances are additive. Thus the variance Ai in the direction of an eigenvector Ui is composed of the sum of a contribution Ai - (J'2 from the projection of the unit-variance latent space distribution into data space through the corresponding column of W, plus an isotropic contribution of variance (J'2 which is added in all directions by the noise model. It is worth taking a moment to study the form of the covariance matrix given by (12.36). Consider the variance of the predictive distribution along some direction specified by the unit vector v, where vTv = 1, which is given by vTCv. First suppose that v is orthogonal to the principal subspace, in other words it is given by some linear combination of the discarded eigenvectors. Then vTV = 0 and hence vTCv = (J'2. Thus the model predicts a noise variance orthogonal to the principal subspace, which, from (12.46), is just the average of the discarded eigenvalues. Now suppose that v = Ui where Ui is one of the retained eigenvectors defining the prin- cipal subspace. Then vTCv = (Ai - (J'2) + (J'2 = Ai. In other words, this model correctly captures the variance of the data along the principal axes, and approximates the variance in all remaining directions with a single average value (J'2. One way to construct the maximum likelihood density model would simply be to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix and then to evaluate Wand (J'2 using the results given above. In this case, we would choose R = I for convenience. However, if the maximum likelihood solution is found by numerical optimization of the likelihood function, for instance using an algorithm such as conjugate gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008) or through the EM algorithm, then the resulting value of R is es- sentially arbitrary. This implies that the columns of W need not be orthogonal. If an orthogonal basis is required, the matrix W can be post-processed appropriately (Golub and Van Loan, 1996). Alternatively, the EM algorithm can be modified in such a way as to yield orthonormal principal directions, sorted in descending order of the corresponding eigenvalues, directly (Ahn and Oh, 2003).",

CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES The rotational invariance in latent space represents a form of statistical noniden- tifiability, analogous to that encountered for mixture models in the case of discrete latent variables. Here there is a continuum of parameters all of which lead to the same predictive density, in contrast to the discrete nonidentifiability associated with component re-labelling in the mixture setting. If we consider the case of M = D, so that there is no reduction of dimension- ality, then U M = U and L M = L. Making use of the orthogonality properties UUT = I and RRT = I, we see that the covariance C of the marginal distribution for x becomes (12.47) and so we obtain the standard maximum likelihood solution for an unconstrained Gaussian distribution in which the covariance matrix is given by the sample covari- ance. Conventional PCA is generally formulated as a projection of points from the D- dimensional data space onto an M -dimensional linear subspace. Probabilistic PCA, however, is most naturally expressed as a mapping from the latent space into the data space via (12.33). For applications such as visualization and data compression, we can reverse this mapping using Bayes' theorem. Any point x in data space can then be summarized by its posterior mean and covariance in latent space. From (12.42) the mean is given by where M is given by (12.41). This projects to a point in data space given by WlE[zlx] + J-L. (12.48) (12.49) Section 3.3.1 Note that this takes the same form as the equations for regularized linear regression and is a consequence of maximizing the likelihood function for a linear Gaussian model. Similarly, the posterior covariance is given from (12.42) by 0-2M- 1 and is independent of x. If we take the limit 0-2 ----t 0, then the posterior mean reduces to (12.50) Exercise 12.11 Exercise 12.12 Section 2.3 which represents an orthogonal projection of the data point onto the latent space, and so we recover the standard PCA model. The posterior covariance in this limit is zero, however, and the density becomes singular. For 0-2 > 0, the latent projection is shifted towards the origin, relative to the orthogonal projection. Finally, we note that an important role for the probabilistic PCA model is in defining a multivariate Gaussian distribution in which the number of degrees of free- dom, in other words the number of independent parameters, can be controlled whilst still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data. Recall that a general Gaussian distribution has D(D + 1)/2 independent parameters in its covariance matrix (plus another D parameters in its mean). Thus the number of parameters scales quadratically with D and can become excessive in spaces of high",

    "text": "12.2. Probabilistic peA 577 dimensionality. If we restrict the covariance matrix to be diagonal, then it has only D independent parameters, and so the number of parameters now grows linearly with dimensionality. However, it now treats the variables as if they were independent and hence can no longer express any correlations between them. Probabilistic PeA pro- vides an elegant compromise in which the M most significant correlations can be captured while still ensuring that the total number of parameters grows only linearly with D. We can see this by evaluating the number of degrees of freedom in the PPCA model as follows. The covariance matrix C depends on the parameters W, which has size D x M, and a 2 , giving a total parameter count of DM+ 1. However, we have seen that there is some redundancy in this parameterization associated with rotations of the coordinate system in the latent space. The orthogonal matrix R that expresses these rotations has size M x M. In the first column of this matrix there are M - 1 independent parameters, because the column vector must be normalized to unit length. In the second column there are M - 2 independent parameters, because the column must be normalized and also must be orthogonal to the previous column, and so on. Summing this arithmetic series, we see that R has a total of M(M -1)/2 independent parameters. Thus the number of degrees of freedom in the covariance matrix C is given by DM + 1 - M(M - 1)/2. (12.51) Exercise 12.14 Section 12.2.4 Section 9.4 The number of independent parameters in this model therefore only grows linearly with D, for fixed M. If we take M = D - 1, then we recover the standard result for a full covariance Gaussian. In this case, the variance along D - 1 linearly in- dependent directions is controlled by the columns of W, and the variance along the remaining direction is given by a 2 . If M = 0, the model is equivalent to the isotropic covariance case. 12.2.2 EM algorithm for peA As we have seen, the probabilistic PCA model can be expressed in terms of a marginalization over a continuous latent space z in which for each data point X n , there is a corresponding latent variable Zn. We can therefore make use of the EM algorithm to find maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters. This may seem rather pointless because we have already obtained an exact closed-form so- lution for the maximum likelihood parameter values. However, in spaces of high dimensionality, there may be computational advantages in using an iterative EM procedure rather than working directly with the sample covariance matrix. This EM procedure can also be extended to the factor analysis model, for which there is no closed-form solution. Finally, it allows missing data to be handled in a principled way. We can derive the EM algorithm for probabilistic PCA by following the general framework for EM. Thus we write down the complete-data log likelihood and take its expectation with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent distribution evaluated using 'old' parameter values. Maximization of this expected complete- data log likelihood then yields the 'new' parameter values. Because the data points",

We already know that the exact maximum likelihood solution for JL is given by the sample mean x defined by (12.1), and it is convenient to substitute for JL at this stage. Making use of the expressions (12.31) and (12.32) for the latent and conditional distributions, respectively, and tak- ing the expectation with respect to the posterior distribution over the latent variables, we obtain Note that this depends on the posterior distribution only through the sufficient statis- tics of the Gaussian.

Here M is defined by (12.41). In the M step, we maximize with respect to Wand (J2, keeping the posterior statistics fixed. Maximization with respect to (T2 is straightforward.

    "text": "(12.58) 12.2. Probabilistic peA 579 eigenvector decomposition of the sample covariance matrix, the EM approach is iterative and so might appear to be less attractive. However, each cycle of the EM algorithm can be computationally much more efficient than conventional PCA in spaces of high dimensionality. To see this, we note that the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix requires O(D3 ) computation. Often we are interested only in the first M eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues, in which case we can use algorithms that are 0 (MD 2 ). However, the evaluation of the covariance matrix itself takes 0 (ND 2 ) computations, where N is the number of data points. Algorithms such as the snapshot method (Sirovich, 1987), which assume that the eigenvectors are linear combinations of the data vectors, avoid direct evaluation of the covariance matrix but are O(N3 ) and hence unsuited to large data sets. The EM algorithm described here also does not construct the covariance matrix explicitly. Instead, the most computationally demanding steps are those involving sums over the data set that are 0 (NDM). For large D, and M \u00ab D, this can be a significant saving compared to 0 (ND 2 ) and can offset the iterative nature of the EM algorithm. Note that this EM algorithm can be implemented in an on-line form in which each D-dimensional data point is read in and processed and then discarded before the next data point is considered. To see this, note that the quantities evaluated in the E step (an M-dimensional vector and an M x M matrix) can be computed for each data point separately, and in the M step we need to accumulate sums over data points, which we can do incrementally. This approach can be advantageous if both Nand D are large. Because we now have a fully probabilistic model for PCA, we can deal with missing data, provided that it is missing at random, by marginalizing over the dis- tribution of the unobserved variables. Again these missing values can be treated using the EM algorithm. We give an example of the use of this approach for data visualization in Figure 12.11. Another elegant feature ofthe EM approach is that we can take the limit a 2 ----t 0, corresponding to standard PCA, and still obtain a valid EM-like algorithm (Roweis, 1998). From (12.55), we see that the only quantity we need to compute in the Estep is JE[zn]. Furthermore, the M step is simplifie~ because M = WTW. To emphasize the simplicity of the algorithm, let us define X to be a matrix of size N x D whose nth row is given by the vector X n - x and similarly define 0 to be a matrix of size D x M whose nth row is given by the vector JE[zn]. The Estep (12.54) of the EM algorithm for PCA then becomes o = (W~dWold)-lW~dX and the M step (12.56) takes the form W new = XTOT(OOT)-l. (12.59) Again these can be implemented in an on-line form. These equations have a simple interpretation as follows. From our earlier discussion, we see that the E step involves an orthogonal projection of the data points onto the current estimate for the principal subspace. Correspondingly, the M step represents a re-estimation of the principal",

It involves a specific choice of prior over W that allows surplus dimensions in the principal subspace to be pruned out of the model. This corresponds to an example of automatic relevance determination, or ARD, discussed in Section 7.2.2. Specifically, we define an independent Gaussian prior over each column of W, which represent the vectors defining the principal subspace. Each such Gaussian has an independent variance governed by a precision hyperparameter O:i so that (12.60) Section 7.2 where Wi is the i th column of W. The resulting model can be represented using the directed graph shown in Figure 12.13. The values for O:i will be found iteratively by maximizing the marginallikeli- hood function in which W has been integrated out. As a result of this optimization, some of the O:i may be driven to infinity, with the corresponding parameters vec- tor Wi being driven to zero (the posterior distribution becomes a delta function at the origin) giving a sparse solution. The effective dimensionality of the principal subspace is then determined by the number of finite O:i values, and the correspond- ing vectors Wi can be thought of as 'relevant' for modelling the data distribution. In this way, the Bayesian approach is automatically making the trade-off between improving the fit to the data, by using a larger number of vectors Wi with their cor- responding eigenvalues Ai each tuned to the data, and reducing the complexity of the model by suppressing some of the Wi vectors. The origins of this sparsity were discussed earlier in the context of relevance vector machines. The values of O:i are re-estimated during training by maximizing the log marginal likelihood given by p(Xla, J-L, 0'2) = Jp(XIW, J-L, O'2)p(Wla) dW (12.61) where the log ofp(XIW, J-L, 0'2) is given by (12.43).

If we assume that the posterior distribution is sharply peaked, as will occur for sufficiently large data sets, then the re-estimation equations obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood with respect to ai take the simple form (12.62) which follows from (3.98), noting that the dimensionality of Wi is D. These re- estimations are interleaved with the EM algorithm updates for determining Wand a 2 \u2022 The E-step equations are again given by (12.54) and (12.55). Similarly, the M- step equation for a 2 is again given by (12.57). The only change is to the M-step equation for W, which is modified to give (12.63) where A = diag(ai)' The value of I-\" is given by the sample mean, as before. If we choose M = D - 1 then, if all ai values are finite, the model represents a full-covariance Gaussian, while if all the ai go to infinity the model is equivalent to an isotropic Gaussian, and so the model can encompass all pennissible values for the effective dimensionality of the principal subspace. It is also possible to consider smaller values of M, which will save on computational cost but which will limit the maximum dimensionality of the subspace. A comparison of the results of this algorithm with standard probabilistic PCA is shown in Figure 12.14. Bayesian PCA provides an opportunity to illustrate the Gibbs sampling algo- rithm discussed in Section 11.3. Figure 12.15 shows an example of the samples from the hyperparameters In ai for a data set in D = 4 dimensions in which the di- mensionality of the latent space is M = 3 but in which the data set is generated from a probabilistic PCA model having one direction of high variance, with the remaining directions comprising low variance noise. This result shows clearly the presence of three distinct modes in the posterior distribution. At each step of the iteration, one of the hyperparameters has a small value and the remaining two have large values, so that two of the three latent variables are suppressed. During the course of the Gibbs sampling, the solution makes sharp transitions between the three modes. The model described here involves a prior only over the matrix W. A fully Bayesian treatment of PCA, including priors over 1-\", a 2 , and n, and solved us- ing variational methods, is described in Bishop (1999b). For a discussion of vari- ous Bayesian approaches to detennining the appropriate dimensionality for a PCA model, see Minka (2001c). 12.2.4 Factor analysis Factor analysis is a linear-Gaussian latent variable model that is closely related to probabilistic PCA.

In order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall assume that we have already subtracted the sample mean from each of the vectors X n , so that Ln Xn = O. The first step is to express conventional PCA in such a form that the data vectors {xn } appear only in the form of the scalar products x~X m . Recall that the principal components are defined by the eigenvectors Ui of the covariance matrix SUi = AiUi (12.71) where i = 1, ... ,D. Here the D x D sample covariance matrix S is defined by (12.72) and the eigenvectors are normalized such that uT Ui = 1.

Note that the solutions of (12.79) and (12.80) differ only by eigenvectors of K having zero eigenvalues that do not affect the principal components projection. The normalization condition for the coefficients ai is obtained by requiring that the eigenvectors in feature space be normalized. Using (12.76) and (12.80), we have N N 1 = V;Vi = L L ainaim\u00a2(xn)T\u00a2(xm) = a;K~ = AiNa;ai' (12.81) n=l m=l Having solved the eigenvector problem, the resulting principal component pro- jections can then also be cast in terms of the kernel function so that, using (12.76), the projection of a point x onto eigenvector i is given by N N Yi(X) = \u00a2(x)TVi = L ain\u00a2(x)T\u00a2(xn) = L aink(X, x n) (12.82) n=l n=l and so again is expressed in terms of the kernel function. In the original D-dimensional x space there are D orthogonal eigenvectors and hence we can find at most D linear principal components. The dimensionality M of the feature space, however, can be much larger than D (even infinite), and thus we can find a number of nonlinear principal components that can exceed D. Note, however, that the number of nonzero eigenvalues cannot exceed the number N of data points, because (even if M > N) the covariance matrix in feature space has rank at most equal to N. This is reflected in the fact that kernel PCA involves the eigenvector expansion of the N x N matrix K.",

Nonlinear Latent Variable Models Exercise 12.28 In this chapter, we have focussed on the simplest class of models having continuous latent variables, namely those based on linear-Gaussian distributions. As well as having great practical importance, these models are relatively easy to analyse and to fit to data and can also be used as components in more complex models. Here we consider briefly some generalizations of this framework to models that are either nonlinear or non-Gaussian, or both. In fact, the issues of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity are related because a general probability density can be obtained from a simple fixed reference density, such as a Gaussian, by making a nonlinear change of variables. This idea forms the basis of several practical latent variable models as we shall see shortly. 12.4.1 Independent component analysis We begin by considering models in which the observed variables are related linearly to the latent variables, but for which the latent distribution is non-Gaussian. An important class of such models, known as independent component analysis, or leA, arises when we consider a distribution over the latent variables that factorizes, so that M p(z) = IIp(Zj). j=l (12.89) To understand the role of such models, consider a situation in which two people are talking at the same time, and we record their voices using two microphones. If we ignore effects such as time delay and echoes, then the signals received by the microphones at any point in time will be given by linear combinations of the amplitudes of the two voices. The coefficients of this linear combination will be constant, and if we can infer their values from sample data, then we can invert the mixing process (assuming it is nonsingular) and thereby obtain two clean signals each of which contains the voice ofjust one person. This is an example of a problem called blind source separation in which 'blind' refers to the fact that we are given only the mixed data, and neither the original sources nor the mixing coefficients are observed (Cardoso, 1998). This type of problem is sometimes addressed using the following approach (MacKay, 2003) in which we ignore the temporal nature of the signals and treat the successive samples as i.i.d. We consider a generative model in which there are two latent variables corresponding to the unobserved speech signal amplitudes, and there are two observed variables given by the signal values at the microphones. The latent variables have a joint distribution that factorizes as above, and the observed variables are given by a linear combination of the latent variables. There is no need to include a noise distribution because the number of latent variables equals the number of ob- served variables, and therefore the marginal distribution of the observed variables will not in general be singular, so the observed variables are simply deterministic linear combinations of the latent variables. Given a data set of observations, the",

The log likelihood can be maximized using gradient-based optimization giving rise to a particular version of independent component analysis. The success of this approach requires that the latent variables have non-Gaussian distributions. To see this, recall that in probabilistic PCA (and in factor analysis) the latent-space distribution is given by a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian. The model therefore cannot distinguish between two different choices for the latent variables where these differ simply by a rotation in latent space. This can be verified directly by noting that the marginal density (12.35), and hence the likelihood function, is unchanged if we make the transformation W -) WR where R is an orthogonal matrix satisfying RRT = I, because the matrix C given by (12.36) is itself invariant. Extending the model to allow more general Gaussian latent distributions does not change this conclusion because, as we have seen, such a model is equivalent to the zero-mean isotropic Gaussian latent variable model. Another way to see why a Gaussian latent variable distribution in a linear model is insufficient to find independent components is to note that the principal compo- nents represent a rotation of the coordinate system in data space such as to diagonal- ize the covariance matrix, so that the data distribution in the new coordinates is then uncorrelated. Although zero correlation is a necessary condition for independence it is not, however, sufficient. In practice, a common choice for the latent-variable distribution is given by 1 p(z) = --,.-----,- J 7fcosh(zj) 1 (12.90) which has heavy tails compared to a Gaussian, reflecting the observation that many real-world distributions also exhibit this property. The original ICA model (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) was based on the optimiza- tion of an objective function defined by information maximization. One advantage of a probabilistic latent variable formulation is that it helps to motivate and formu- late generalizations of basic ICA. For instance, independent factor analysis (Attias, 1999a) considers a model in which the number of latent and observed variables can differ, the observed variables are noisy, and the individual latent variables have flex- ible distributions modelled by mixtures of Gaussians. The log likelihood for this model is maximized using EM, and the reconstruction of the latent variables is ap- proximated using a variational approach. Many other types of model have been considered, and there is now a huge literature on ICA and its applications (Jutten and Herault, 1991; Comon et at., 1991; Amari et at., 1996; Pearlmutter and Parra, 1997; Hyvarinen and Oja, 1997; Hinton et at., 2001; Miskin and MacKay, 2001; Hojen-Sorensen et at., 2002; Choudrey and Roberts, 2003; Chan et at., 2003; Stone, 2004). 12.4.2 Autoassociative neural networks In Chapter 5 we considered neural networks in the context of supervised learn- ing, where the role of the network is to predict the output variables given values",

Even with non- linear units in the hidden layer, such a network is equivalent to linear principal component anal- ysis. Links representing bias parameters have been omitted for clarity. inputs outputs (12.91) for the input variables. However, neural networks have also been applied to un- supervised learning where they have been used for dimensionality reduction. This is achieved by using a network having the same number of outputs as inputs, and optimizing the weights so as to minimize some measure of the reconstruction error between inputs and outputs with respect to a set of training data. Consider first a multilayer perceptron of the form shown in Figure 12.18, hav- ing D inputs, D output units and M hidden units, with M < D. The targets used to train the network are simply the input vectors themselves, so that the network is attempting to map each input vector onto itself. Such a network is said to form an autoassociative mapping. Since the number of hidden units is smaller than the number of inputs, a perfect reconstruction of all input vectors is not in general pos- sible. We therefore determine the network parameters w by minimizing an error function which captures the degree of mismatch between the input vectors and their reconstructions. In particular, we shall choose a sum-of-squares error of the form 1 N E(w) = \"2 L Ily(xn , w) - xn 11 2 \u2022 n=l If the hidden units have linear activations functions, then it can be shown that the error function has a unique global minimum, and that at this minimum the network performs a projection onto the M -dimensional subspace which is spanned by the first M principal components of the data (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988; Baldi and Hornik, 1989). Thus, the vectors of weights which lead into the hidden units in Figure 12.18 form a basis set which spans the principal subspace. Note, however, that these vec- tors need not be orthogonal or normalized. This result is unsurprising, since both principal component analysis and the neural network are using linear dimensionality reduction and are minimizing the same sum-of-squares error function. It might be thought that the limitations of a linear dimensionality reduction could be overcome by using nonlinear (sigmoidal) activation functions for the hidden units in the network in Figure 12.18. However, even with nonlinear hidden units, the min- imum error solution is again given by the projection onto the principal component subspace (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988). There is therefore no advantage in using two- layer neural networks to perform dimensionality reduction. Standard techniques for principal component analysis (based on singular value decomposition) are guaran- teed to give the correct solution in finite time, and they also generate an ordered set of eigenvalues with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors.",

Nonlinear Latent Variable Models 595 It has the advantage of not being limited to linear transformations, although it con- tains standard principal component analysis as a special case. However, training the network now involves a nonlinear optimization problem, since the error function (12.91) is no longer a quadratic function of the network parameters. Computation- ally intensive nonlinear optimization techniques must be used, and there is the risk of finding a suboptimal local minimum of the error function. Also, the dimensionality of the subspace must be specified before training the network. 12.4.3 Modelling nonlinear manifolds As we have already noted, many natural sources of data correspond to low- dimensional, possibly noisy, nonlinear manifolds embedded within the higher di- mensional observed data space. Capturing this property explicitly can lead to im- proved density modelling compared with more general methods. Here we consider briefly a range of techniques that attempt to do this. One way to model the nonlinear structure is through a combination of linear models, so that we make a piece-wise linear approximation to the manifold. This can be obtained, for instance, by using a clustering technique such as K -means based on Euclidean distance to partition the data set into local groups with standard PCA ap- plied to each group. A better approach is to use the reconstruction error for cluster assignment (Kambhatla and Leen, 1997; Hinton et al., 1997) as then a common cost function is being optimized in each stage. However, these approaches still suffer from limitations due to the absence of an overall density model. By using prob- abilistic PCA it is straightforward to define a fully probabilistic model simply by considering a mixture distribution in which the components are probabilistic PCA models (Tipping and Bishop, 1999a). Such a model has both discrete latent vari- ables, corresponding to the discrete mixture, as well as continuous latent variables, and the likelihood function can be maximized using the EM algorithm. A fully Bayesian treatment, based on variational inference (Bishop and Winn, 2000), allows the number of components in the mixture, as well as the effective dimensionalities of the individual models, to be inferred from the data. There are many variants of this model in which parameters such as the W matrix or the noise variances are tied across components in the mixture, or in which the isotropic noise distributions are replaced by diagonal ones, giving rise to a mixture of factor analysers (Ghahramani and Hinton, 1996a; Ghahramani and Beal, 2000). The mixture of probabilistic PCA models can also be extended hierarchically to produce an interactive data visualiza- tion algorithm (Bishop and Tipping, 1998). An alternative to considering a mixture of linear models is to consider a single nonlinear model. Recall that conventional PCA finds a linear subspace that passes close to the data in a least-squares sense. This concept can be extended to one- dimensional nonlinear surfaces in the form of principal curves (Hastie and Stuetzle, 1989). We can describe a curve in a D-dimensional data space using a vector-valued function f ().), which is a vector each of whose elements is a function of the scalar ).. There are many possible ways to parameterize the curve, of which a natural choice is the arc length along the curve. For any given point xin data space, we can find the point on the curve that is closest in Euclidean distance. We denote this point by",

For a continuous data density p(x), a principal curve is defined as one for which every point on the curve is the mean of all those points in data space that project to it, so that JE [Xlgf(X) = >..] = f(>\"). (12.92) For a given continuous density, there can be many principal curves. In practice, we are interested in finite data sets, and we also wish to restrict attention to smooth curves. Hastie and Stuetzle (1989) propose a two-stage iterative procedure for find- ing such principal curves, somewhat reminiscent of the EM algorithm for PCA. The curve is initialized using the first principal component, and then the algorithm alter- nates between a data projection step and curve re-estimation step. In the projection step, each data point is assigned to a value of >.. corresponding to the closest point on the curve. Then in the re-estimation step, each point on the curve is given by a weighted average of those points that project to nearby points on the curve, with points closest on the curve given the greatest weight. In the case where the subspace is constrained to be linear, the procedure converges to the first principal component and is equivalent to the power method for finding the largest eigenvector of the co- variance matrix. Principal curves can be generalized to multidimensional manifolds called principal surfaces although these have found limited use due to the difficulty of data smoothing in higher dimensions even for two-dimensional manifolds. PCA is often used to project a data set onto a lower-dimensional space, for ex- ample two dimensional, for the purposes of visualization. Another linear technique with a similar aim is multidimensional scaling, or MDS (Cox and Cox, 2000). It finds a low-dimensional projection of the data such as to preserve, as closely as possible, the pairwise distances between data points, and involves finding the eigenvectors of the distance matrix. In the case where the distances are Euclidean, it gives equivalent results to PCA. The MDS concept can be extended to a wide variety of data types specified in terms of a similarity matrix, giving nonmetric MDS. Two other nonprobabilistic methods for dimensionality reduction and data vi- sualization are worthy of mention. Locally linear embedding, or LLE (Roweis and Saul, 2000) first computes the set of coefficients that best reconstructs each data point from its neighbours. These coefficients are arranged to be invariant to rota- tions, translations, and scalings of that data point and its neighbours, and hence they characterize the local geometrical properties of the neighbourhood. LLE then maps the high-dimensional data points down to a lower dimensional space while preserv- ing these neighbourhood coefficients. If the local neighbourhood for a particular data point can be considered linear, then the transformation can be achieved using a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling, such as to preserve the angles formed between the data points and their neighbours. Because the weights are in- variant to these transformations, we expect the same weight values to reconstruct the data points in the low-dimensional space as in the high-dimensional data space. In spite of the nonlinearity, the optimization for LLE does not exhibit local minima. In isometric feature mapping, or isomap (Tenenbaum et ai., 2000), the goal is to project the data to a lower-dimensional space using MDS, but where the dissim- ilarities are defined in terms of the geodesic distances measured along the mani-",

For instance, if two points lie on a circle, then the geodesic is the arc-length distance measured around the circumference of the circle not the straight line dis- tance measured along the chord connecting them. The algorithm first defines the neighbourhood for each data point, either by finding the K nearest neighbours or by finding all points within a sphere of radius E. A graph is then constructed by link- ing all neighbouring points and labelling them with their Euclidean distance. The geodesic distance between any pair of points is then approximated by the sum of the arc lengths along the shortest path connecting them (which itself is found using standard algorithms). Finally, metric MDS is applied to the geodesic distance matrix to find the low-dimensional projection. Our focus in this chapter has been on models for which the observed vari- ables are continuous. We can also consider models having continuous latent vari- ables together with discrete observed variables, giving rise to latent trait models (Bartholomew, 1987). In this case, the marginalization over the continuous latent variables, even for a linear relationship between latent and observed variables, can- not be performed analytically, and so more sophisticated techniques are required. Tipping (1999) uses variational inference in a model with a two-dimensional latent space, allowing a binary data set to be visualized analogously to the use of PCA to visualize continuous data. Note that this model is the dual of the Bayesian logistic regression problem discussed in Section 4.5. In the case of logistic regression we have N observations of the feature vector <l>n which are parameterized by a single parameter vector w, whereas in the latent space visualization model there is a single latent space variable x (analogous to <1\u00bb and N copies of the latent variable W n . A generalization of probabilistic latent variable models to general exponential family distributions is described in Collins et al. (2002). We have already noted that an arbitrary distribution can be formed by taking a Gaussian random variable and transforming it through a suitable nonlinearity. This is exploited in a general latent variable model called a density network (MacKay, 1995; MacKay and Gibbs, 1999) in which the nonlinear function is governed by a multilayered neural network. If the network has enough hidden units, it can approx- imate a given nonlinear function to any desired accuracy. The downside of having such a flexible model is that the marginalization over the latent variables, required in order to obtain the likelihood function, is no longer analytically tractable. Instead, the likelihood is approximated using Monte Carlo techniques by drawing samples from the Gaussian prior. The marginalization over the latent variables then becomes a simple sum with one term for each sample. However, because a large number of sample points may be required in order to give an accurate representation of the marginal, this procedure can be computationally costly. If we consider more restricted forms for the nonlinear function, and make an ap- propriate choice of the latent variable distribution, then we can construct a latent vari- able model that is both nonlinear and efficient to train. The generative topographic mapping, or GTM (Bishop et aI., 1996; Bishop et aI., 1997a; Bishop et aI., 1998b) uses a latent distribution that is defined by a finite regular grid of delta functions over the (typically two-dimensional) latent space. Marginalization over the latent space then simply involves summing over the contributions from each of the grid locations.",

Because the manifold in GTM is defined as a continuous surface, not just at the prototype vectors as in the SOM, it is possible to compute the magnification factors corresponding to the local expansions and compressions of the manifold needed to fit the data set (Bishop et al., 1997b) as well as the directional curvatures of the manifold (Tino et al., 2001). These can be visualized along with the projected data and provide additional insight into the model. Exercises 12.1 (* *) lIB In this exercise, we use proof by induction to show that the linear projection onto an M -dimensional subspace that maximizes the variance of the pro- jected data is defined by the M eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S, given by (12.3), corresponding to the M largest eigenvalues. In Section 12.1, this result was proven for the case of M = 1. Now suppose the result holds for some general value of M and show that it consequently holds for dimensionality M + 1. To do this, first set the derivative of the variance of the projected data with respect to a vector UM+1 defining the new direction in data space equal to zero. This should be done subject to the constraints that UM+l be orthogonal to the existing vectors U1,\"\" UM, and also that it be normalized to unit length. Use Lagrange multipli- Appendix E ers to enforce these constraints. Then make use of the orthonormality properties of the vectors U1,\"\" UM to show that the new vector UM+1 is an eigenvector of S. Finally, show that the variance is maximized if the eigenvector is chosen to be the one corresponding to eigenvector AM+1 where the eigenvalues have been ordered in decreasing value. 12.2 (**) Show that the minimum value of the PCA distortion measure J given by (12.15) with respect to the Ui, subject to the orthonormality constraints (12.7), is obtained when the Ui are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S. To do this, introduce a matrix H of Lagrange multipliers, one for each constraint, so that the modified distortion measure, in matrix notation reads ] = Tr { UTSU}+ Tr { H(I - UTU)} (12.93) where Uis a m~trix of dimensio~D x (D - M) whose columns are gi:::..en b~ Ui. Now minimize J with respect to U and show that the s~ution satisfies SU = UH. Clearly, one possible solution is that the columns of U are eigenvectors of S, in which case H is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues. To obtain the general solution, show that H can be assumed to be a symmetr~ ma~ix, and by using its eigenvect\u00a3r expansion show that the general solution to SU =~UH gives the same value for J as the specific solution in which the columns of U are",

This assumption allowed us to express the likelihood function as the product over all data points of the prob- ability distribution evaluated at each data point. For many applications, however, the i.i.d. assumption will be a poor one. Here we consider a particularly important class of such data sets, namely those that describe sequential data. These often arise through measurement of time series, for example the rainfall measurements on suc- cessive days at a particular location, or the daily values of a currency exchange rate, or the acoustic features at successive time frames used for speech recognition. An example involving speech data is shown in Figure 13.1. Sequential data can also arise in contexts other than time series, for example the sequence of nucleotide base pairs along a strand of DNA or the sequence of characters in an English sentence.

It is useful to distinguish between stationary and nonstationary sequential dis- tributions.

For the more complex nonstationary situa- tion, the generative distribution itself is evolving with time. Here we shall focus on the stationary case. For many applications, such as \ufb01nancial forecasting, we wish to be able to pre- dict the next value in a time series given observations of the previous values. In- tuitively, we expect that recent observations are likely to be more informative than more historical observations in predicting future values. The example in Figure 13.1 shows that successive observations of the speech spectrum are indeed highly cor- related.

Although such models are tractable, they are also severely limited. We can ob- tain a more general framework, while still retaining tractability, by the introduction of latent variables, leading to state space models. As in Chapters 9 and 12, we shall see that complex models can thereby be constructed from simpler components (in particular, from distributions belonging to the exponential family) and can be read- ily characterized using the framework of probabilistic graphical models. Here we focus on the two most important examples of state space models, namely the hid- den Markov model, in which the latent variables are discrete, and linear dynamical systems, in which the latent variables are Gaussian. Both models are described by di- rected graphs having a tree structure (no loops) for which inference can be performed ef\ufb01ciently using the sum-product algorithm. 13.1. Markov Models The easiest way to treat sequential data would be simply to ignore the sequential aspects and treat the observations as i.i.d., corresponding to the graph in Figure 13.2. Such an approach, however, would fail to exploit the sequential patterns in the data, such as correlations between observations that are close in the sequence. Suppose, for instance, that we observe a binary variable denoting whether on a particular day it rained or not. Given a time series of recent observations of this variable, we wish to predict whether it will rain on the next day. If we treat the data as i.i.d., then the only information we can glean from the data is the relative frequency of rainy days. However, we know in practice that the weather often exhibits trends that may last for several days. Observing whether or not it rains today is therefore of signi\ufb01cant help in predicting if it will rain tomorrow. To express such effects in a probabilistic model, we need to relax the i.i.d. as- sumption, and one of the simplest ways to do this is to consider a Markov model. First of all we note that, without loss of generality, we can use the product rule to express the joint distribution for a sequence of observations in the form p(x1, . . . , xN) = N \u000e n=1 p(xn|x1, . . . , xn\u22121).

SEQUENTIAL DATA Figure 13.3 A \ufb01rst-order Markov chain of ob- servations {xn} in which the dis- tribution p(xn|xn\u22121) of a particu- lar observation xn is conditioned on the value of the previous ob- servation xn\u22121. x1 x2 x3 x4 joint distribution for a sequence of N observations under this model is given by p(x1, . . . , xN) = p(x1) N \u000e n=2 p(xn|xn\u22121). (13.2) From the d-separation property, we see that the conditional distribution for observa- Section 8.2 tion xn, given all of the observations up to time n, is given by p(xn|x1, . . . , xn\u22121) = p(xn|xn\u22121) (13.3) which is easily veri\ufb01ed by direct evaluation starting from (13.2) and using the prod- uct rule of probability. Thus if we use such a model to predict the next observation Exercise 13.1 in a sequence, the distribution of predictions will depend only on the value of the im- mediately preceding observation and will be independent of all earlier observations. In most applications of such models, the conditional distributions p(xn|xn\u22121) that de\ufb01ne the model will be constrained to be equal, corresponding to the assump- tion of a stationary time series. The model is then known as a homogeneous Markov chain. For instance, if the conditional distributions depend on adjustable parameters (whose values might be inferred from a set of training data), then all of the condi- tional distributions in the chain will share the same values of those parameters. Although this is more general than the independence model, it is still very re- strictive. For many sequential observations, we anticipate that the trends in the data over several successive observations will provide important information in predict- ing the next value. One way to allow earlier observations to have an in\ufb02uence is to move to higher-order Markov chains. If we allow the predictions to depend also on the previous-but-one value, we obtain a second-order Markov chain, represented by the graph in Figure 13.4.

We can similarly consider extensions to an M th order Markov chain in which the conditional distri- bution for a particular variable depends on the previous M variables. However, we have paid a price for this increased \ufb02exibility because the number of parameters in the model is now much larger. Suppose the observations are discrete variables hav- ing K states. Then the conditional distribution p(xn|xn\u22121) in a \ufb01rst-order Markov chain will be speci\ufb01ed by a set of K \u22121 parameters for each of the K states of xn\u22121 giving a total of K(K \u22121) parameters. Now suppose we extend the model to an M th order Markov chain, so that the joint distribution is built up from conditionals p(xn|xn\u2212M, . . . , xn\u22121). If the variables are discrete, and if the conditional distri- butions are represented by general conditional probability tables, then the number of parameters in such a model will have KM\u22121(K \u22121) parameters. Because this grows exponentially with M, it will often render this approach impractical for larger values of M. For continuous variables, we can use linear-Gaussian conditional distributions in which each node has a Gaussian distribution whose mean is a linear function of its parents. This is known as an autoregressive or AR model (Box et al., 1994; Thiesson et al., 2004). An alternative approach is to use a parametric model for p(xn|xn\u2212M, . . . , xn\u22121) such as a neural network. This technique is sometimes called a tapped delay line because it corresponds to storing (delaying) the previous M values of the observed variable in order to predict the next value. The number of parameters can then be much smaller than in a completely general model (for ex- ample it may grow linearly with M), although this is achieved at the expense of a restricted family of conditional distributions. Suppose we wish to build a model for sequences that is not limited by the Markov assumption to any order and yet that can be speci\ufb01ed using a limited number of free parameters. We can achieve this by introducing additional latent variables to permit a rich class of models to be constructed out of simple components, as we did with mixture distributions in Chapter 9 and with continuous latent variable models in Chapter 12. For each observation xn, we introduce a corresponding latent variable zn (which may be of different type or dimensionality to the observed variable). We now assume that it is the latent variables that form a Markov chain, giving rise to the graphical structure known as a state space model, which is shown in Figure 13.5. It satis\ufb01es the key conditional independence property that zn\u22121 and zn+1 are indepen- dent given zn, so that zn+1 \u22a5\u22a5zn\u22121 | zn. (13.5)",

(13.6) Using the d-separation criterion, we see that there is always a path connecting any two observed variables xn and xm via the latent variables, and that this path is never blocked. Thus the predictive distribution p(xn+1|x1, . . . , xn) for observation xn+1 given all previous observations does not exhibit any conditional independence prop- erties, and so our predictions for xn+1 depends on all previous observations. The observed variables, however, do not satisfy the Markov property at any order. We shall discuss how to evaluate the predictive distribution in later sections of this chap- ter. There are two important models for sequential data that are described by this graph. If the latent variables are discrete, then we obtain the hidden Markov model, or HMM (Elliott et al., 1995). Note that the observed variables in an HMM may Section 13.2 be discrete or continuous, and a variety of different conditional distributions can be used to model them. If both the latent and the observed variables are Gaussian (with a linear-Gaussian dependence of the conditional distributions on their parents), then we obtain the linear dynamical system. Section 13.3 13.2. Hidden Markov Models The hidden Markov model can be viewed as a speci\ufb01c instance of the state space model of Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete. However, if we examine a single time slice of the model, we see that it corresponds to a mixture distribution, with component densities given by p(x|z). It can therefore also be interpreted as an extension of a mixture model in which the choice of mixture com- ponent for each observation is not selected independently but depends on the choice of component for the previous observation. The HMM is widely used in speech recognition (Jelinek, 1997; Rabiner and Juang, 1993), natural language modelling (Manning and Sch\u00a8utze, 1999), on-line handwriting recognition (Nag et al., 1986), and for the analysis of biological sequences such as proteins and DNA (Krogh et al., 1994; Durbin et al., 1998; Baldi and Brunak, 2001). As in the case of a standard mixture model, the latent variables are the discrete multinomial variables zn describing which component of the mixture is responsible for generating the corresponding observation xn. Again, it is convenient to use a 1-of-K coding scheme, as used for mixture models in Chapter 9. We now allow the probability distribution of zn to depend on the state of the previous latent variable zn\u22121 through a conditional distribution p(zn|zn\u22121). Because the latent variables are K-dimensional binary variables, this conditional distribution corresponds to a table of numbers that we denote by A, the elements of which are known as transition probabilities. They are given by Ajk \u2261p(znk = 1|zn\u22121,j = 1), and because they are probabilities, they satisfy 0 \u2a7dAjk \u2a7d1 with \u0005 k Ajk = 1, so that the matrix A",

The transition matrix is sometimes illustrated diagrammatically by drawing the states as nodes in a state transition diagram as shown in Figure 13.6 for the case of K = 3. Note that this does not represent a probabilistic graphical model, because the nodes are not separate variables but rather states of a single variable, and so we have shown the states as boxes rather than circles. It is sometimes useful to take a state transition diagram, of the kind shown in Figure 13.6, and unfold it over time. This gives an alternative representation of the transitions between latent states, known as a lattice or trellis diagram, and which is Section 8.4.5 shown for the case of the hidden Markov model in Figure 13.7. The speci\ufb01cation of the probabilistic model is completed by de\ufb01ning the con- ditional distributions of the observed variables p(xn|zn, \u03c6), where \u03c6 is a set of pa- rameters governing the distribution. These are known as emission probabilities, and might for example be given by Gaussians of the form (9.11) if the elements of x are continuous variables, or by conditional probability tables if x is discrete.

(13.9) We shall focuss attention on homogeneous models for which all of the condi- tional distributions governing the latent variables share the same parameters A, and similarly all of the emission distributions share the same parameters \u03c6 (the extension to more general cases is straightforward). Note that a mixture model for an i.i.d. data set corresponds to the special case in which the parameters Ajk are the same for all values of j, so that the conditional distribution p(zn|zn\u22121) is independent of zn\u22121. This corresponds to deleting the horizontal links in the graphical model shown in Figure 13.5. The joint probability distribution over both latent and observed variables is then given by p(X, Z|\u03b8) = p(z1|\u03c0) N \u000e n=2 p(zn|zn\u22121, A) N \u000e m=1 p(xm|zm, \u03c6) (13.10) where X = {x1, . . . , xN}, Z = {z1, . . . , zN}, and \u03b8 = {\u03c0, A, \u03c6} denotes the set of parameters governing the model. Most of our discussion of the hidden Markov model will be independent of the particular choice of the emission probabilities. Indeed, the model is tractable for a wide range of emission distributions including discrete tables, Gaussians, and mixtures of Gaussians. It is also possible to exploit discriminative models such as neural networks. These can be used to model the Exercise 13.4 emission density p(x|z) directly, or to provide a representation for p(z|x) that can be converted into the required emission density p(x|z) using Bayes\u2019 theorem (Bishop et al., 2004). We can gain a better understanding of the hidden Markov model by considering it from a generative point of view. Recall that to generate samples from a mixture of",

Gaussians, we \ufb01rst chose one of the components at random with probability given by the mixing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0k and then generate a sample vector x from the correspond- ing Gaussian component. This process is repeated N times to generate a data set of N independent samples. In the case of the hidden Markov model, this procedure is modi\ufb01ed as follows. We \ufb01rst choose the initial latent variable z1 with probabilities governed by the parameters \u03c0k and then sample the corresponding observation x1. Now we choose the state of the variable z2 according to the transition probabilities p(z2|z1) using the already instantiated value of z1. Thus suppose that the sample for z1 corresponds to state j. Then we choose the state k of z2 with probabilities Ajk for k = 1, . . . , K. Once we know z2 we can draw a sample for x2 and also sample the next latent variable z3 and so on. This is an example of ancestral sampling for a directed graphical model. If, for instance, we have a model in which the diago- Section 8.1.2 nal transition elements Akk are much larger than the off-diagonal elements, then a typical data sequence will have long runs of points generated from a single compo- nent, with infrequent transitions from one component to another. The generation of samples from a hidden Markov model is illustrated in Figure 13.8. There are many variants of the standard HMM model, obtained for instance by imposing constraints on the form of the transition matrix A (Rabiner, 1989).

Typically for such models the initial state probabilities for p(z1) are modi\ufb01ed so that p(z11) = 1 and p(z1j) = 0 for j \u0338= 1, in other words every sequence is constrained to start in state j = 1. The transition matrix may be further constrained to ensure that large changes in the state index do not occur, so that Ajk = 0 if k > j + \u2206. This type of model is illustrated using a lattice diagram in Figure 13.10. Many applications of hidden Markov models, for example speech recognition, or on-line character recognition, make use of left-to-right architectures. As an illus- tration of the left-to-right hidden Markov model, we consider an example involving handwritten digits. This uses on-line data, meaning that each digit is represented by the trajectory of the pen as a function of time in the form of a sequence of pen coordinates, in contrast to the off-line digits data, discussed in Appendix A, which comprises static two-dimensional pixellated images of the ink. Examples of the on- line digits are shown in Figure 13.11. Here we train a hidden Markov model on a subset of data comprising 45 examples of the digit \u20182\u2019. There are K = 16 states, each of which can generate a line segment of \ufb01xed length having one of 16 possible angles, and so the emission distribution is simply a 16 \u00d7 16 table of probabilities associated with the allowed angle values for each state index value. Transition prob- abilities are all set to zero except for those that keep the state index k the same or that increment it by 1, and the model parameters are optimized using 25 iterations of EM. We can gain some insight into the resulting model by running it generatively, as shown in Figure 13.11.

Bottom row: synthetic digits sam- pled generatively from a left-to-right hid- den Markov model that has been trained on a data set of 45 handwritten digits. One of the most powerful properties of hidden Markov models is their ability to exhibit some degree of invariance to local warping (compression and stretching) of the time axis. To understand this, consider the way in which the digit \u20182\u2019 is written in the on-line handwritten digits example. A typical digit comprises two distinct sections joined at a cusp. The \ufb01rst part of the digit, which starts at the top left, has a sweeping arc down to the cusp or loop at the bottom left, followed by a second more- or-less straight sweep ending at the bottom right. Natural variations in writing style will cause the relative sizes of the two sections to vary, and hence the location of the cusp or loop within the temporal sequence will vary. From a generative perspective such variations can be accommodated by the hidden Markov model through changes in the number of transitions to the same state versus the number of transitions to the successive state. Note, however, that if a digit \u20182\u2019 is written in the reverse order, that is, starting at the bottom right and ending at the top left, then even though the pen tip coordinates may be identical to an example from the training set, the probability of the observations under the model will be extremely small. In the speech recognition context, warping of the time axis is associated with natural variations in the speed of speech, and again the hidden Markov model can accommodate such a distortion and not penalize it too heavily. 13.2.1 Maximum likelihood for the HMM If we have observed a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we can determine the param- eters of an HMM using maximum likelihood. The likelihood function is obtained from the joint distribution (13.10) by marginalizing over the latent variables p(X|\u03b8) = \u0002 Z p(X, Z|\u03b8). (13.11) Because the joint distribution p(X, Z|\u03b8) does not factorize over n (in contrast to the mixture distribution considered in Chapter 9), we cannot simply treat each of the summations over zn independently. Nor can we perform the summations explicitly because there are N variables to be summed over, each of which has K states, re- sulting in a total of KN terms. Thus the number of terms in the summation grows",

In fact, the summation in (13.11) cor- responds to summing over exponentially many paths through the lattice diagram in Figure 13.7. We have already encountered a similar dif\ufb01culty when we considered the infer- ence problem for the simple chain of variables in Figure 8.32. There we were able to make use of the conditional independence properties of the graph to re-order the summations in order to obtain an algorithm whose cost scales linearly, instead of exponentially, with the length of the chain. We shall apply a similar technique to the hidden Markov model. A further dif\ufb01culty with the expression (13.11) for the likelihood function is that, because it corresponds to a generalization of a mixture distribution, it represents a summation over the emission models for different settings of the latent variables. Direct maximization of the likelihood function will therefore lead to complex ex- pressions with no closed-form solutions, as was the case for simple mixture models Section 9.2 (recall that a mixture model for i.i.d. data is a special case of the HMM). We therefore turn to the expectation maximization algorithm to \ufb01nd an ef\ufb01cient framework for maximizing the likelihood function in hidden Markov models. The EM algorithm starts with some initial selection for the model parameters, which we denote by \u03b8old. In the E step, we take these parameter values and \ufb01nd the posterior distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, \u03b8old). We then use this posterior distri- bution to evaluate the expectation of the logarithm of the complete-data likelihood function, as a function of the parameters \u03b8, to give the function Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) de\ufb01ned by Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = \u0002 Z p(Z|X, \u03b8old) ln p(X, Z|\u03b8). (13.12) At this point, it is convenient to introduce some notation. We shall use \u03b3(zn) to denote the marginal posterior distribution of a latent variable zn, and \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) to denote the joint posterior distribution of two successive latent variables, so that \u03b3(zn) = p(zn|X, \u03b8old) (13.13) \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) = p(zn\u22121, zn|X, \u03b8old). (13.14) For each value of n, we can store \u03b3(zn) using a set of K nonnegative numbers that sum to unity, and similarly we can store \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) using a K \u00d7 K matrix of nonnegative numbers that again sum to unity. We shall also use \u03b3(znk) to denote the conditional probability of znk = 1, with a similar use of notation for \u03be(zn\u22121,j, znk) and for other probabilistic variables introduced later. Because the expectation of a binary random variable is just the probability that it takes the value 1, we have \u03b3(znk) = E[znk] = \u0002 z \u03b3(z)znk (13.15) \u03be(zn\u22121,j, znk) = E[zn\u22121,jznk] = \u0002 z \u03b3(z)zn\u22121,jznk.

(13.17) The goal of the E step will be to evaluate the quantities \u03b3(zn) and \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) ef\ufb01- ciently, and we shall discuss this in detail shortly. In the M step, we maximize Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) with respect to the parameters \u03b8 = {\u03c0, A, \u03c6} in which we treat \u03b3(zn) and \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) as constant. Maximization with respect to \u03c0 and A is easily achieved using appropriate Lagrange multipliers with the results Exercise 13.5 \u03c0k = \u03b3(z1k) K \u0002 j=1 \u03b3(z1j) (13.18) Ajk = N \u0002 n=2 \u03be(zn\u22121,j, znk) K \u0002 l=1 N \u0002 n=2 \u03be(zn\u22121,j, znl) . (13.19) The EM algorithm must be initialized by choosing starting values for \u03c0 and A, which should of course respect the summation constraints associated with their probabilis- tic interpretation. Note that any elements of \u03c0 or A that are set to zero initially will remain zero in subsequent EM updates. A typical initialization procedure would Exercise 13.6 involve selecting random starting values for these parameters subject to the summa- tion and non-negativity constraints. Note that no particular modi\ufb01cation to the EM results are required for the case of left-to-right models beyond choosing initial values for the elements Ajk in which the appropriate elements are set to zero, because these will remain zero throughout. To maximize Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) with respect to \u03c6k, we notice that only the \ufb01nal term in (13.17) depends on \u03c6k, and furthermore this term has exactly the same form as the data-dependent term in the corresponding function for a standard mixture dis- tribution for i.i.d. data, as can be seen by comparison with (9.40) for the case of a Gaussian mixture. Here the quantities \u03b3(znk) are playing the role of the responsibil- ities. If the parameters \u03c6k are independent for the different components, then this term decouples into a sum of terms one for each value of k, each of which can be maximized independently. We are then simply maximizing the weighted log likeli- hood function for the emission density p(x|\u03c6k) with weights \u03b3(znk). Here we shall suppose that this maximization can be done ef\ufb01ciently. For instance, in the case of",

In the particular context of the hidden Markov Section 8.4 model, this is known as the forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989), or the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972).

As well as being of great practical importance in its own right, the forward- backward algorithm provides us with a nice illustration of many of the concepts introduced in earlier chapters. We shall therefore begin in this section with a \u2018con- ventional\u2019 derivation of the forward-backward equations, making use of the sum and product rules of probability, and exploiting conditional independence properties which we shall obtain from the corresponding graphical model using d-separation. Then in Section 13.2.3, we shall see how the forward-backward algorithm can be obtained very simply as a speci\ufb01c example of the sum-product algorithm introduced in Section 8.4.4. It is worth emphasizing that evaluation of the posterior distributions of the latent variables is independent of the form of the emission density p(x|z) or indeed of whether the observed variables are continuous or discrete. All we require is the values of the quantities p(xn|zn) for each value of zn for every n. Also, in this section and the next we shall omit the explicit dependence on the model parameters \u03b8old because these \ufb01xed throughout. We therefore begin by writing down the following conditional independence properties (Jordan, 2007) p(X|zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn|zn) p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn) (13.24) p(x1, . . . , xn\u22121|xn, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn\u22121|zn) (13.25) p(x1, . . . , xn\u22121|zn\u22121, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn\u22121|zn\u22121) (13.26) p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn, zn+1) = p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn+1) (13.27) p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1, xn+1) = p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1) (13.28) p(X|zn\u22121, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn\u22121|zn\u22121) p(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn) (13.29) p(xN+1|X, zN+1) = p(xN+1|zN+1) (13.30) p(zN+1|zN, X) = p(zN+1|zN) (13.31) where X = {x1, . . . , xN}. These relations are most easily proved using d-separation. For instance in the \ufb01rst of these results, we note that every path from any one of the nodes x1, . . . , xn\u22121 to the node xn passes through the node zn, which is observed. Because all such paths are head-to-tail, it follows that the conditional independence property must hold. The reader should take a few moments to verify each of these properties in turn, as an exercise in the application of d-separation. These relations can also be proved directly, though with signi\ufb01cantly greater effort, from the joint distribution for the hidden Markov model using the sum and product rules of proba- bility. Exercise 13.10 Let us begin by evaluating \u03b3(znk).

The forward recursion equation for \u03b1(zn) is illustrated using a lattice diagram in Figure 13.12.

Starting at the \ufb01rst node of the chain, we can then work along the chain and evaluate \u03b1(zn) for every latent node. Because each step of the recursion involves multiplying by a K \u00d7 K matrix, the overall cost of evaluating these quantities for the whole chain is of O(K2N). We can similarly \ufb01nd a recursion relation for the quantities \u03b2(zn) by making use of the conditional independence properties (13.27) and (13.28) giving \u03b2(zn) = p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn) = \u0002 zn+1 p(xn+1, . . . , xN, zn+1|zn) = \u0002 zn+1 p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn, zn+1)p(zn+1|zn) = \u0002 zn+1 p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn+1)p(zn+1|zn) = \u0002 zn+1 p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1)p(xn+1|zn+1)p(zn+1|zn).",

(13.38) Note that in this case we have a backward message passing algorithm that evaluates \u03b2(zn) in terms of \u03b2(zn+1). At each step, we absorb the effect of observation xn+1 through the emission probability p(xn+1|zn+1), multiply by the transition matrix p(zn+1|zn), and then marginalize out zn+1. This is illustrated in Figure 13.13. Again we need a starting condition for the recursion, namely a value for \u03b2(zN). This can be obtained by setting n = N in (13.33) and replacing \u03b1(zN) with its de\ufb01nition (13.34) to give p(zN|X) = p(X, zN)\u03b2(zN) p(X) (13.39) which we see will be correct provided we take \u03b2(zN) = 1 for all settings of zN. In the M step equations, the quantity p(X) will cancel out, as can be seen, for instance, in the M-step equation for \u00b5k given by (13.20), which takes the form \u00b5k = n \u0002 n=1 \u03b3(znk)xn n \u0002 n=1 \u03b3(znk) = n \u0002 n=1 \u03b1(znk)\u03b2(znk)xn n \u0002 n=1 \u03b1(znk)\u03b2(znk) . (13.40) However, the quantity p(X) represents the likelihood function whose value we typ- ically wish to monitor during the EM optimization, and so it is useful to be able to evaluate it. If we sum both sides of (13.33) over zn, and use the fact that the left-hand side is a normalized distribution, we obtain p(X) = \u0002 zn \u03b1(zn)\u03b2(zn). (13.41)",

For instance, if we only want to evaluate the likelihood function, then we can do this by running the \u03b1 recursion from the start to the end of the chain, and then use this result for n = N, making use of the fact that \u03b2(zN) is a vector of 1s. In this case no \u03b2 recursion is required, and we simply have p(X) = \u0002 zN \u03b1(zN). (13.42) Let us take a moment to interpret this result for p(X). Recall that to compute the likelihood we should take the joint distribution p(X, Z) and sum over all possible values of Z. Each such value represents a particular choice of hidden state for every time step, in other words every term in the summation is a path through the lattice diagram, and recall that there are exponentially many such paths. By expressing the likelihood function in the form (13.42), we have reduced the computational cost from being exponential in the length of the chain to being linear by swapping the order of the summation and multiplications, so that at each time step n we sum the contributions from all paths passing through each of the states znk to give the intermediate quantities \u03b1(zn). Next we consider the evaluation of the quantities \u03be(zn\u22121, zn), which correspond to the values of the conditional probabilities p(zn\u22121, zn|X) for each of the K \u00d7 K settings for (zn\u22121, zn). Using the de\ufb01nition of \u03be(zn\u22121, zn), and applying Bayes\u2019 theorem, we have \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) = p(zn\u22121, zn|X) = p(X|zn\u22121, zn)p(zn\u22121, zn) p(X) = p(x1, . . . , xn\u22121|zn\u22121)p(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)p(zn|zn\u22121)p(zn\u22121) p(X) = \u03b1(zn\u22121)p(xn|zn)p(zn|zn\u22121)\u03b2(zn) p(X) (13.43) where we have made use of the conditional independence property (13.29) together with the de\ufb01nitions of \u03b1(zn) and \u03b2(zn) given by (13.34) and (13.35). Thus we can calculate the \u03be(zn\u22121, zn) directly by using the results of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 recursions. Let us summarize the steps required to train a hidden Markov model using the EM algorithm. We \ufb01rst make an initial selection of the parameters \u03b8old where \u03b8 \u2261(\u03c0, A, \u03c6). The A and \u03c0 parameters are often initialized either uniformly or randomly from a uniform distribution (respecting their non-negativity and summa- tion constraints). Initialization of the parameters \u03c6 will depend on the form of the distribution. For instance in the case of Gaussians, the parameters \u00b5k might be ini- tialized by applying the K-means algorithm to the data, and \u03a3k might be initialized to the covariance matrix of the corresponding K means cluster. Then we run both the forward \u03b1 recursion and the backward \u03b2 recursion and use the results to evaluate \u03b3(zn) and \u03be(zn\u22121, zn). At this stage, we can also evaluate the likelihood function.",

We then continue to alternate between E and M steps until some convergence criterion is satis\ufb01ed, for instance when the change in the likelihood function is below some threshold. Note that in these recursion relations the observations enter through conditional distributions of the form p(xn|zn). The recursions are therefore independent of the type or dimensionality of the observed variables or the form of this conditional distribution, so long as its value can be computed for each of the K possible states of zn. Since the observed variables {xn} are \ufb01xed, the quantities p(xn|zn) can be pre-computed as functions of zn at the start of the EM algorithm, and remain \ufb01xed throughout. We have seen in earlier chapters that the maximum likelihood approach is most effective when the number of data points is large in relation to the number of parame- ters. Here we note that a hidden Markov model can be trained effectively, using max- imum likelihood, provided the training sequence is suf\ufb01ciently long. Alternatively, we can make use of multiple shorter sequences, which requires a straightforward modi\ufb01cation of the hidden Markov model EM algorithm. In the case of left-to-right Exercise 13.12 models, this is particularly important because, in a given observation sequence, a given state transition corresponding to a nondiagonal element of A will seen at most once. Another quantity of interest is the predictive distribution, in which the observed data is X = {x1, . . . , xN} and we wish to predict xN+1, which would be important for real-time applications such as \ufb01nancial forecasting. Again we make use of the sum and product rules together with the conditional independence properties (13.29) and (13.31) giving p(xN+1|X) = \u0002 zN+1 p(xN+1, zN+1|X) = \u0002 zN+1 p(xN+1|zN+1)p(zN+1|X) = \u0002 zN+1 p(xN+1|zN+1) \u0002 zN p(zN+1, zN|X) = \u0002 zN+1 p(xN+1|zN+1) \u0002 zN p(zN+1|zN)p(zN|X) = \u0002 zN+1 p(xN+1|zN+1) \u0002 zN p(zN+1|zN)p(zN, X) p(X) = 1 p(X) \u0002 zN+1 p(xN+1|zN+1) \u0002 zN p(zN+1|zN)\u03b1(zN) (13.44) which can be evaluated by \ufb01rst running a forward \u03b1 recursion and then computing the \ufb01nal summations over zN and zN+1. The result of the \ufb01rst summation over zN can be stored and used once the value of xN+1 is observed in order to run the \u03b1 recursion forward to the next step in order to predict the subsequent value xN+2.",

Thus the predictive distribution can be carried forward inde\ufb01nitely using a \ufb01xed amount of storage, as may be required for real-time applications. Here we have discussed the estimation of the parameters of an HMM using max- imum likelihood. This framework is easily extended to regularized maximum likeli- hood by introducing priors over the model parameters \u03c0, A and \u03c6 whose values are then estimated by maximizing their posterior probability. This can again be done us- ing the EM algorithm in which the E step is the same as discussed above, and the M step involves adding the log of the prior distribution p(\u03b8) to the function Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) before maximization and represents a straightforward application of the techniques developed at various points in this book. Furthermore, we can use variational meth- ods to give a fully Bayesian treatment of the HMM in which we marginalize over the Section 10.1 parameter distributions (MacKay, 1997). As with maximum likelihood, this leads to a two-pass forward-backward recursion to compute posterior probabilities. 13.2.3 The sum-product algorithm for the HMM The directed graph that represents the hidden Markov model, shown in Fig- ure 13.5, is a tree and so we can solve the problem of \ufb01nding local marginals for the hidden variables using the sum-product algorithm. Not surprisingly, this turns out to Section 8.4.4 be equivalent to the forward-backward algorithm considered in the previous section, and so the sum-product algorithm therefore provides us with a simple way to derive the alpha-beta recursion formulae. We begin by transforming the directed graph of Figure 13.5 into a factor graph, of which a representative fragment is shown in Figure 13.14. This form of the fac- tor graph shows all variables, both latent and observed, explicitly. However, for the purpose of solving the inference problem, we shall always be conditioning on the variables x1, . . . , xN, and so we can simplify the factor graph by absorbing the emission probabilities into the transition probability factors. This leads to the sim- pli\ufb01ed factor graph representation in Figure 13.15, in which the factors are given by h(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1) (13.45) fn(zn\u22121, zn) = p(zn|zn\u22121)p(xn|zn). (13.46)",

From the general results (8.66) and (8.69) for message propagation, we see that the messages which are propagated in the hidden Markov model take the form \u00b5zn\u22121\u2192fn(zn\u22121) = \u00b5fn\u22121\u2192zn\u22121(zn\u22121) (13.47) \u00b5fn\u2192zn(zn) = \u0002 zn\u22121 fn(zn\u22121, zn)\u00b5zn\u22121\u2192fn(zn\u22121) (13.48) These equations represent the propagation of messages forward along the chain and are equivalent to the alpha recursions derived in the previous section, as we shall now show. Note that because the variable nodes zn have only two neighbours, they perform no computation. We can eliminate \u00b5zn\u22121\u2192fn(zn\u22121) from (13.48) using (13.47) to give a recur- sion for the f \u2192z messages of the form \u00b5fn\u2192zn(zn) = \u0002 zn\u22121 fn(zn\u22121, zn)\u00b5fn\u22121\u2192zn\u22121(zn\u22121).

We also need to verify that the quantities \u03b1(zn) are themselves equivalent to those de\ufb01ned previously. This is easily done by using the initial condition (8.71) and noting that \u03b1(z1) is given by h(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1) which is identical to (13.37). Because the initial \u03b1 is the same, and because they are iteratively computed using the same equation, all subsequent \u03b1 quantities must be the same. Next we consider the messages that are propagated from the root node back to the leaf node. These take the form \u00b5fn+1\u2192fn(zn) = \u0002 zn+1 fn+1(zn, zn+1)\u00b5fn+2\u2192fn+1(zn+1) (13.51) where, as before, we have eliminated the messages of the type z \u2192f since the variable nodes perform no computation.

The sum-product algorithm also speci\ufb01es how to evaluate the marginals once all the messages have been evaluated. In particular, the result (8.63) shows that the local marginal at the node zn is given by the product of the incoming messages. Because we have conditioned on the variables X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we are computing the joint distribution p(zn, X) = \u00b5fn\u2192zn(zn)\u00b5fn+1\u2192zn(zn) = \u03b1(zn)\u03b2(zn). (13.53) Dividing both sides by p(X), we then obtain \u03b3(zn) = p(zn, X) p(X) = \u03b1(zn)\u03b2(zn) p(X) (13.54) in agreement with (13.33). The result (13.43) can similarly be derived from (8.72). Exercise 13.11 13.2.4 Scaling factors There is an important issue that must be addressed before we can make use of the forward backward algorithm in practice. From the recursion relation (13.36), we note that at each step the new value \u03b1(zn) is obtained from the previous value \u03b1(zn\u22121) by multiplying by quantities p(zn|zn\u22121) and p(xn|zn). Because these probabilities are often signi\ufb01cantly less than unity, as we work our way forward along the chain, the values of \u03b1(zn) can go to zero exponentially quickly. For moderate lengths of chain (say 100 or so), the calculation of the \u03b1(zn) will soon exceed the dynamic range of the computer, even if double precision \ufb02oating point is used. In the case of i.i.d. data, we implicitly circumvented this problem with the eval- uation of likelihood functions by taking logarithms. Unfortunately, this will not help here because we are forming sums of products of small numbers (we are in fact im- plicitly summing over all possible paths through the lattice diagram of Figure 13.7). We therefore work with re-scaled versions of \u03b1(zn) and \u03b2(zn) whose values remain of order unity. As we shall see, the corresponding scaling factors cancel out when we use these re-scaled quantities in the EM algorithm. In (13.34), we de\ufb01ned \u03b1(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn) representing the joint distri- bution of all the observations up to xn and the latent variable zn. Now we de\ufb01ne a normalized version of \u03b1 given by \u0001\u03b1(zn) = p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) = \u03b1(zn) p(x1, . . . , xn) (13.55) which we expect to be well behaved numerically because it is a probability distribu- tion over K variables for any value of n.

This \u03b1\u2013\u03b3 recursion requires that the forward pass be completed \ufb01rst so that all the quantities \u0001\u03b1(zn) are available for the backward pass, whereas the forward and backward passes of the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 algorithm can be done independently. Although these two algorithms have comparable computational cost, the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 version is the most commonly encountered one in the case of hidden Markov models, whereas for linear dynamical systems a Section 13.3 recursion analogous to the \u03b1\u2013\u03b3 form is more usual. 13.2.5 The Viterbi algorithm In many applications of hidden Markov models, the latent variables have some meaningful interpretation, and so it is often of interest to \ufb01nd the most probable sequence of hidden states for a given observation sequence. For instance in speech recognition, we might wish to \ufb01nd the most probable phoneme sequence for a given series of acoustic observations. Because the graph for the hidden Markov model is a directed tree, this problem can be solved exactly using the max-sum algorithm. We recall from our discussion in Section 8.4.5 that the problem of \ufb01nding the most probable sequence of latent states is not the same as that of \ufb01nding the set of states that are individually the most probable. The latter problem can be solved by \ufb01rst running the forward-backward (sum-product) algorithm to \ufb01nd the latent variable marginals \u03b3(zn) and then maximizing each of these individually (Duda et al., 2001). However, the set of such states will not, in general, correspond to the most probable sequence of states. In fact, this set of states might even represent a sequence having zero probability, if it so happens that two successive states, which in isolation are individually the most probable, are such that the transition matrix element connecting them is zero. In practice, we are usually interested in \ufb01nding the most probable sequence of states, and this can be solved ef\ufb01ciently using the max-sum algorithm, which in the context of hidden Markov models is known as the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967). Note that the max-sum algorithm works with log probabilities and so there is no need to use re-scaled variables as was done with the forward-backward algorithm. Figure 13.16 shows a fragment of the hidden Markov model expanded as lattice diagram. As we have already noted, the number of possible paths through the lattice grows exponentially with the length of the chain. The Viterbi algorithm searches this space of paths ef\ufb01ciently to \ufb01nd the most probable path with a computational cost that grows only linearly with the length of the chain. As with the sum-product algorithm, we \ufb01rst represent the hidden Markov model as a factor graph, as shown in Figure 13.15. Again, we treat the variable node zN as the root, and pass messages to the root starting with the leaf nodes. Using the results (8.93) and (8.94), we see that the messages passed in the max-sum algorithm are given by \u00b5zn\u2192fn+1(zn) = \u00b5fn\u2192zn(zn) (13.66) \u00b5fn+1\u2192zn+1(zn+1) = max zn \u001a ln fn+1(zn, zn+1) + \u00b5zn\u2192fn+1(zn)\u001b .

The Viterbi algorithm can also be derived directly from the de\ufb01nition (13.6) of the joint distribution by taking the logarithm and then exchanging maximizations and summations. It is easily seen that the quantities \u03c9(zn) have the probabilistic Exercise 13.16 interpretation \u03c9(zn) = max z1,...,zn\u22121 p(x1, . . . , xn, z1, . . . , zn).

Speci\ufb01cally, we note that the maximization over zn must be performed for each of the K possible values of zn+1. Suppose we keep a record of the values of zn that correspond to the maxima for each value of the K values of zn+1. Let us denote this function by \u03c8(kn) where k \u2208{1, . . . , K}. Once we have passed mes- sages to the end of the chain and found the most probable state of zN, we can then use this function to backtrack along the chain by applying it recursively kmax n = \u03c8(kmax n+1).

Naively, we could consider explicitly all of the exponentially many paths through the lattice, evaluate the probability for each, and then select the path having the highest proba- bility. However, we notice that we can make a dramatic saving in computational cost as follows. Suppose that for each path we evaluate its probability by summing up products of transition and emission probabilities as we work our way forward along each path through the lattice. Consider a particular time step n and a particular state k at that time step. There will be many possible paths converging on the correspond- ing node in the lattice diagram. However, we need only retain that particular path that so far has the highest probability. Because there are K states at time step n, we need to keep track of K such paths. At time step n + 1, there will be K2 possible paths to consider, comprising K possible paths leading out of each of the K current states, but again we need only retain K of these corresponding to the best path for each state at time n+1. When we reach the \ufb01nal time step N we will discover which state corresponds to the overall most probable path. Because there is a unique path coming into that state we can trace the path back to step N \u22121 to see what state it occupied at that time, and so on back through the lattice to the state n = 1. 13.2.6 Extensions of the hidden Markov model The basic hidden Markov model, along with the standard training algorithm based on maximum likelihood, has been extended in numerous ways to meet the requirements of particular applications. Here we discuss a few of the more important examples. We see from the digits example in Figure 13.11 that hidden Markov models can be quite poor generative models for the data, because many of the synthetic digits look quite unrepresentative of the training data. If the goal is sequence classi\ufb01ca- tion, there can be signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t in determining the parameters of hidden Markov models using discriminative rather than maximum likelihood techniques. Suppose we have a training set of R observation sequences Xr, where r = 1, . . . , R, each of which is labelled according to its class m, where m = 1, . . . , M. For each class, we have a separate hidden Markov model with its own parameters \u03b8m, and we treat the problem of determining the parameter values as a standard classi\ufb01cation problem in which we optimize the cross-entropy R \u0002 r=1 ln p(mr|Xr). (13.72) Using Bayes\u2019 theorem this can be expressed in terms of the sequence probabilities associated with the hidden Markov models R \u0002 r=1 ln \u0018 p(Xr|\u03b8r)p(mr) \u0005M l=1 p(Xr|\u03b8l)p(lr) \u0019 (13.73) where p(m) is the prior probability of class m. Optimization of this cost function is more complex than for maximum likelihood (Kapadia, 1998), and in particular",

SEQUENTIAL DATA Figure 13.17 Section of an autoregressive hidden Markov model, in which the distribution of the observation xn depends on a subset of the previous observations as well as on the hidden state zn. In this example, the distribution of xn depends on the two previous observations xn\u22121 and xn\u22122. zn\u22121 zn zn+1 xn\u22121 xn xn+1 requires that every training sequence be evaluated under each of the models in or- der to compute the denominator in (13.73). Hidden Markov models, coupled with discriminative training methods, are widely used in speech recognition (Kapadia, 1998). A signi\ufb01cant weakness of the hidden Markov model is the way in which it rep- resents the distribution of times for which the system remains in a given state. To see the problem, note that the probability that a sequence sampled from a given hidden Markov model will spend precisely T steps in state k and then make a transition to a different state is given by p(T) = (Akk)T (1 \u2212Akk) \u221dexp (\u2212T ln Akk) (13.74) and so is an exponentially decaying function of T. For many applications, this will be a very unrealistic model of state duration. The problem can be resolved by mod- elling state duration directly in which the diagonal coef\ufb01cients Akk are all set to zero, and each state k is explicitly associated with a probability distribution p(T|k) of pos- sible duration times. From a generative point of view, when a state k is entered, a value T representing the number of time steps that the system will remain in state k is then drawn from p(T|k). The model then emits T values of the observed variable xt, which are generally assumed to be independent so that the corresponding emis- sion density is simply \u0015T t=1 p(xt|k). This approach requires some straightforward modi\ufb01cations to the EM optimization procedure (Rabiner, 1989). Another limitation of the standard HMM is that it is poor at capturing long- range correlations between the observed variables (i.e., between variables that are separated by many time steps) because these must be mediated via the \ufb01rst-order Markov chain of hidden states. Longer-range effects could in principle be included by adding extra links to the graphical model of Figure 13.5. One way to address this is to generalize the HMM to give the autoregressive hidden Markov model (Ephraim et al., 1989), an example of which is shown in Figure 13.17. For discrete observa- tions, this corresponds to expanded tables of conditional probabilities for the emis- sion distributions. In the case of a Gaussian emission density, we can use the linear- Gaussian framework in which the conditional distribution for xn given the values of the previous observations, and the value of zn, is a Gaussian whose mean is a linear combination of the values of the conditioning variables. Clearly the number of additional links in the graph must be limited to avoid an excessive the number of free parameters. In the example shown in Figure 13.17, each observation depends on",

Although this graph looks messy, we can again appeal to d-separation to see that in fact it still has a simple probabilistic structure. In particular, if we imagine conditioning on zn we see that, as with the standard HMM, the values of zn\u22121 and zn+1 are independent, corresponding to the conditional independence property (13.5). This is easily veri- \ufb01ed by noting that every path from node zn\u22121 to node zn+1 passes through at least one observed node that is head-to-tail with respect to that path. As a consequence, we can again use a forward-backward recursion in the E step of the EM algorithm to determine the posterior distributions of the latent variables in a computational time that is linear in the length of the chain. Similarly, the M step involves only a minor modi\ufb01cation of the standard M-step equations. In the case of Gaussian emission densities this involves estimating the parameters using the standard linear regression equations, discussed in Chapter 3. We have seen that the autoregressive HMM appears as a natural extension of the standard HMM when viewed as a graphical model. In fact the probabilistic graphical modelling viewpoint motivates a plethora of different graphical structures based on the HMM. Another example is the input-output hidden Markov model (Bengio and Frasconi, 1995), in which we have a sequence of observed variables u1, . . . , uN, in addition to the output variables x1, . . . , xN, whose values in\ufb02uence either the dis- tribution of latent variables or output variables, or both. An example is shown in Figure 13.18. This extends the HMM framework to the domain of supervised learn- ing for sequential data. It is again easy to show, through the use of the d-separation criterion, that the Markov property (13.5) for the chain of latent variables still holds. To verify this, simply note that there is only one path from node zn\u22121 to node zn+1 and this is head-to-tail with respect to the observed node zn. This conditional inde- pendence property again allows the formulation of a computationally ef\ufb01cient learn- ing algorithm. In particular, we can determine the parameters \u03b8 of the model by maximizing the likelihood function L(\u03b8) = p(X|U, \u03b8) where U is a matrix whose rows are given by uT n. As a consequence of the conditional independence property (13.5) this likelihood function can be maximized ef\ufb01ciently using an EM algorithm in which the E step involves forward and backward recursions.

Figure 13.19 shows the corresponding graphical model. The motivation for considering factorial HMM can be seen by noting that in order to represent, say, 10 bits of information at a given time step, a standard HMM would need K = 210 = 1024 latent states, whereas a factorial HMM could make use of 10 binary latent chains. The primary disadvantage of factorial HMMs, however, lies in the additional complexity of training them. The M step for the factorial HMM model is straightforward. However, observation of the x variables introduces dependencies between the latent chains, leading to dif\ufb01culties with the E step. This can be seen by noting that in Figure 13.19, the variables z(1) n and z(2) n are connected by a path which is head-to-head at node xn and hence they are not d-separated. The exact E step for this model does not correspond to running forward and backward recursions along the M Markov chains independently. This is con\ufb01rmed by noting that the key conditional independence property (13.5) is not satis\ufb01ed for the individual Markov chains in the factorial HMM model, as is shown using d-separation in Figure 13.20. Now suppose that there are M chains of hidden nodes and for simplicity suppose that all latent variables have the same number K of states.

We can then run the standard forward-backward recursions in the E step. This has computational com- plexity O(NK2M) that is exponential in the number M of latent chains and so will be intractable for anything other than small values of M. One solution would be to use sampling methods (discussed in Chapter 11). As an elegant deterministic al- ternative, Ghahramani and Jordan (1997) exploited variational inference techniques Section 10.1 to obtain a tractable algorithm for approximate inference. This can be done using a simple variational posterior distribution that is fully factorized with respect to the latent variables, or alternatively by using a more powerful approach in which the variational distribution is described by independent Markov chains corresponding to the chains of latent variables in the original model. In the latter case, the variational inference algorithms involves running independent forward and backward recursions along each chain, which is computationally ef\ufb01cient and yet is also able to capture correlations between variables within the same chain. Clearly, there are many possible probabilistic structures that can be constructed according to the needs of particular applications. Graphical models provide a general technique for motivating, describing, and analysing such structures, and variational methods provide a powerful framework for performing inference in those models for which exact solution is intractable. 13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems In order to motivate the concept of linear dynamical systems, let us consider the following simple problem, which often arises in practical settings. Suppose we wish to measure the value of an unknown quantity z using a noisy sensor that returns a observation x representing the value of z plus zero-mean Gaussian noise. Given a single measurement, our best guess for z is to assume that z = x. However, we can improve our estimate for z by taking lots of measurements and averaging them, because the random noise terms will tend to cancel each other. Now let\u2019s make the situation more complicated by assuming that we wish to measure a quantity z that is changing over time. We can take regular measurements of x so that at some point in time we have obtained x1, . . . , xN and we wish to \ufb01nd the corresponding values z1, . . . , xN. If we simply average the measurements, the error due to random noise will be reduced, but unfortunately we will just obtain a single averaged estimate, in which we have averaged over the changing value of z, thereby introducing a new source of error. Intuitively, we could imagine doing a bit better as follows. To estimate the value of zN, we take only the most recent few measurements, say xN\u2212L, . . . , xN and just average these. If z is changing slowly, and the random noise level in the sensor is high, it would make sense to choose a relatively long window of observations to average. Conversely, if the signal is changing quickly, and the noise levels are small, we might be better just to use xN directly as our estimate of zN. Perhaps we could do even better if we take a weighted average, in which more recent measurements",

Although this sort of intuitive argument seems plausible, it does not tell us how to form a weighted average, and any sort of hand-crafted weighing is hardly likely to be optimal. Fortunately, we can address problems such as this much more sys- tematically by de\ufb01ning a probabilistic model that captures the time evolution and measurement processes and then applying the inference and learning methods devel- oped in earlier chapters. Here we shall focus on a widely used model known as a linear dynamical system. As we have seen, the HMM corresponds to the state space model shown in Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete but with arbitrary emission probability distributions. This graph of course describes a much broader class of probability distributions, all of which factorize according to (13.6). We now consider extensions to other distributions for the latent variables. In particular, we consider continuous latent variables in which the summations of the sum-product algorithm become integrals. The general form of the inference algorithms will, however, be the same as for the hidden Markov model. It is interesting to note that, historically, hidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems were developed independently. Once they are both expressed as graphical models, however, the deep relationship between them immediately becomes apparent. One key requirement is that we retain an ef\ufb01cient algorithm for inference which is linear in the length of the chain. This requires that, for instance, when we take a quantity \u0001\u03b1(zn\u22121), representing the posterior probability of zn given observations x1, . . . , xn, and multiply by the transition probability p(zn|zn\u22121) and the emission probability p(xn|zn) and then marginalize over zn\u22121, we obtain a distribution over zn that is of the same functional form as that over \u0001\u03b1(zn\u22121). That is to say, the distribution must not become more complex at each stage, but must only change in its parameter values. Not surprisingly, the only distributions that have this property of being closed under multiplication are those belonging to the exponential family. Here we consider the most important example from a practical perspective, which is the Gaussian. In particular, we consider a linear-Gaussian state space model so that the latent variables {zn}, as well as the observed variables {xn}, are multi- variate Gaussian distributions whose means are linear functions of the states of their parents in the graph. We have seen that a directed graph of linear-Gaussian units is equivalent to a joint Gaussian distribution over all of the variables. Furthermore, marginals such as \u0001\u03b1(zn) are also Gaussian, so that the functional form of the mes- sages is preserved and we will obtain an ef\ufb01cient inference algorithm. By contrast, suppose that the emission densities p(xn|zn) comprise a mixture of K Gaussians each of which has a mean that is linear in zn. Then even if \u0001\u03b1(z1) is Gaussian, the quantity \u0001\u03b1(z2) will be a mixture of K Gaussians, \u0001\u03b1(z3) will be a mixture of K2 Gaussians, and so on, and exact inference will not be of practical value. We have seen that the hidden Markov model can be viewed as an extension of the mixture models of Chapter 9 to allow for sequential correlations in the data. In a similar way, we can view the linear dynamical system as a generalization of the continuous latent variable models of Chapter 12 such as probabilistic PCA and factor analysis. Each pair of nodes {zn, xn} represents a linear-Gaussian latent variable",

Because the model is represented by a tree-structured directed graph, inference problems can be solved ef\ufb01ciently using the sum-product algorithm. The forward re- cursions, analogous to the \u03b1 messages of the hidden Markov model, are known as the Kalman \ufb01lter equations (Kalman, 1960; Zarchan and Musoff, 2005), and the back- ward recursions, analogous to the \u03b2 messages, are known as the Kalman smoother equations, or the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) equations (Rauch et al., 1965). The Kalman \ufb01lter is widely used in many real-time tracking applications. Because the linear dynamical system is a linear-Gaussian model, the joint distri- bution over all variables, as well as all marginals and conditionals, will be Gaussian. It follows that the sequence of individually most probable latent variable values is the same as the most probable latent sequence. There is thus no need to consider the Exercise 13.19 analogue of the Viterbi algorithm for the linear dynamical system. Because the model has linear-Gaussian conditional distributions, we can write the transition and emission distributions in the general form p(zn|zn\u22121) = N(zn|Azn\u22121, \u0393) (13.75) p(xn|zn) = N(xn|Czn, \u03a3).

(13.77) Note that in order to simplify the notation, we have omitted additive constant terms from the means of the Gaussians. In fact, it is straightforward to include them if desired. Traditionally, these distributions are more commonly expressed in an equiv- Exercise 13.24 alent form in terms of noisy linear equations given by zn = Azn\u22121 + wn (13.78) xn = Czn + vn (13.79) z1 = \u00b50 + u (13.80) where the noise terms have the distributions w \u223c N(w|0, \u0393) (13.81) v \u223c N(v|0, \u03a3) (13.82) u \u223c N(u|0, V0).

In the E step, we need to solve the inference problem of determining the local posterior marginals for the latent variables, which can be solved ef\ufb01ciently using the sum-product algorithm, as we discuss in the next section.",

For given parameter settings, we also wish to make predictions of the next latent state zn and of the next observation xn conditioned on the observed data x1, . . . , xn\u22121 for use in real-time applications. These inference problems can be solved ef\ufb01ciently using the sum-product algorithm, which in the context of the linear dynamical system gives rise to the Kalman \ufb01lter and Kalman smoother equations. It is worth emphasizing that because the linear dynamical system is a linear- Gaussian model, the joint distribution over all latent and observed variables is simply a Gaussian, and so in principle we could solve inference problems by using the standard results derived in previous chapters for the marginals and conditionals of a multivariate Gaussian. The role of the sum-product algorithm is to provide a more ef\ufb01cient way to perform such computations. Linear dynamical systems have the identical factorization, given by (13.6), to hidden Markov models, and are again described by the factor graphs in Figures 13.14 and 13.15. Inference algorithms therefore take precisely the same form except that summations over latent variables are replaced by integrations. We begin by consid- ering the forward equations in which we treat zN as the root node, and propagate messages from the leaf node h(z1) to the root. From (13.77), the initial message will be Gaussian, and because each of the factors is Gaussian, all subsequent messages will also be Gaussian. By convention, we shall propagate messages that are nor- malized marginal distributions corresponding to p(zn|x1, . . . , xn), which we denote by \u0001\u03b1(zn) = N(zn|\u00b5n, Vn). (13.84) This is precisely analogous to the propagation of scaled variables \u0001\u03b1(zn) given by (13.59) in the discrete case of the hidden Markov model, and so the recursion equa- tion now takes the form cn\u0001\u03b1(zn) = p(xn|zn) \u0006 \u0001\u03b1(zn\u22121)p(zn|zn\u22121) dzn\u22121.

The integral is easily evaluated by making use of the result (2.115), from which it follows that \u0006 N(zn|Azn\u22121, \u0393)N(zn\u22121|\u00b5n\u22121, Vn\u22121) dzn\u22121 = N(zn|A\u00b5n\u22121, Pn\u22121) (13.87)",

(13.97) Similarly, the likelihood function for the linear dynamical system is given by (13.63) in which the factors cn are found using the Kalman \ufb01ltering equations. We can interpret the steps involved in going from the posterior marginal over zn\u22121 to the posterior marginal over zn as follows. In (13.89), we can view the quantity A\u00b5n\u22121 as the prediction of the mean over zn obtained by simply taking the mean over zn\u22121 and projecting it forward one step using the transition probability matrix A. This predicted mean would give a predicted observation for xn given by CAzn\u22121 obtained by applying the emission probability matrix C to the predicted hidden state mean. We can view the update equation (13.89) for the mean of the hidden variable distribution as taking the predicted mean A\u00b5n\u22121 and then adding a correction that is proportional to the error xn \u2212CAzn\u22121 between the predicted observation and the actual observation. The coef\ufb01cient of this correction is given by the Kalman gain matrix. Thus we can view the Kalman \ufb01lter as a process of making successive predictions and then correcting these predictions in the light of the new observations. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 13.21.",

SEQUENTIAL DATA zn\u22121 zn zn Figure 13.21 The linear dynamical system can be viewed as a sequence of steps in which increasing un- certainty in the state variable due to diffusion is compensated by the arrival of new data. In the left-hand plot, the blue curve shows the distribution p(zn\u22121|x1, . . . , xn\u22121), which incorporates all the data up to step n \u22121. The diffusion arising from the nonzero variance of the transition probability p(zn|zn\u22121) gives the distribution p(zn|x1, . . . , xn\u22121), shown in red in the centre plot. Note that this is broader and shifted relative to the blue curve (which is shown dashed in the centre plot for comparison). The next data observation xn contributes through the emission density p(xn|zn), which is shown as a function of zn in green on the right-hand plot. Note that this is not a density with respect to zn and so is not normalized to one. Inclusion of this new data point leads to a revised distribution p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) for the state density shown in blue. We see that observation of the data has shifted and narrowed the distribution compared to p(zn|x1, . . . , xn\u22121) (which is shown in dashed in the right-hand plot for comparison). If we consider a situation in which the measurement noise is small compared to the rate at which the latent variable is evolving, then we \ufb01nd that the posterior distribution for zn depends only on the current measurement xn, in accordance with Exercise 13.27 the intuition from our simple example at the start of the section. Similarly, if the latent variable is evolving slowly relative to the observation noise level, we \ufb01nd that the posterior mean for zn is obtained by averaging all of the measurements obtained up to that time. Exercise 13.28 One of the most important applications of the Kalman \ufb01lter is to tracking, and this is illustrated using a simple example of an object moving in two dimensions in Figure 13.22. So far, we have solved the inference problem of \ufb01nding the posterior marginal for a node zn given observations from x1 up to xn. Next we turn to the problem of \ufb01nding the marginal for a node zn given all observations x1 to xN. For temporal data, this corresponds to the inclusion of future as well as past observations. Al- though this cannot be used for real-time prediction, it plays a key role in learning the parameters of the model. By analogy with the hidden Markov model, this problem can be solved by propagating messages from node xN back to node x1 and com- bining this information with that obtained during the forward message passing stage used to compute the \u0001\u03b1(zn). In the LDS literature, it is usual to formulate this backward recursion in terms of \u03b3(zn) = \u0001\u03b1(zn)\u0001\u03b2(zn) rather than in terms of \u0001\u03b2(zn). Because \u03b3(zn) must also be Gaussian, we write it in the form \u03b3(zn) = \u0001\u03b1(zn)\u0001\u03b2(zn) = N(zn|\u0001\u00b5n, \u0001Vn).

SEQUENTIAL DATA 13.3.2 Learning in LDS So far, we have considered the inference problem for linear dynamical systems, assuming that the model parameters \u03b8 = {A, \u0393, C, \u03a3, \u00b50, V0} are known. Next, we consider the determination of these parameters using maximum likelihood (Ghahra- mani and Hinton, 1996b). Because the model has latent variables, this can be ad- dressed using the EM algorithm, which was discussed in general terms in Chapter 9. We can derive the EM algorithm for the linear dynamical system as follows. Let us denote the estimated parameter values at some particular cycle of the algorithm by \u03b8old. For these parameter values, we can run the inference algorithm to determine the posterior distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, \u03b8old), or more precisely those local posterior marginals that are required in the M step. In particular, we shall require the following expectations E [zn] = \u0001\u00b5n (13.105) E \b znzT n\u22121 = Jn\u22121 \u0001Vn + \u0001\u00b5n\u0001\u00b5T n\u22121 (13.106) E \b znzT n = \u0001Vn + \u0001\u00b5n\u0001\u00b5T n (13.107) where we have used (13.104). Now we consider the complete-data log likelihood function, which is obtained by taking the logarithm of (13.6) and is therefore given by ln p(X, Z|\u03b8) = ln p(z1|\u00b50, V0) + N \u0002 n=2 ln p(zn|zn\u22121, A, \u0393) + N \u0002 n=1 ln p(xn|zn, C, \u03a3) (13.108) in which we have made the dependence on the parameters explicit. We now take the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood with respect to the posterior distri- bution p(Z|X, \u03b8old) which de\ufb01nes the function Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = EZ|\u03b8old [ln p(X, Z|\u03b8)] . (13.109) In the M step, this function is maximized with respect to the components of \u03b8. Consider \ufb01rst the parameters \u00b50 and V0. If we substitute for p(z1|\u00b50, V0) in (13.108) using (13.77), and then take the expectation with respect to Z, we obtain Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = \u22121 2 ln |V0| \u2212EZ|\u03b8old 1 2(z1 \u2212\u00b50)TV\u22121 0 (z1 \u2212\u00b50) + const where all terms not dependent on \u00b50 or V0 have been absorbed into the additive constant. Maximization with respect to \u00b50 and V0 is easily performed by making use of the maximum likelihood solution for a Gaussian distribution discussed in Section 2.3.4, giving Exercise 13.32",

Inclusion of priors to give a MAP estimate is straightforward, and a fully Bayesian treatment can be found by applying the analytical approxima- tion techniques discussed in Chapter 10, though a detailed treatment is precluded here due to lack of space. 13.3.3 Extensions of LDS As with the hidden Markov model, there is considerable interest in extending the basic linear dynamical system in order to increase its capabilities. Although the assumption of a linear-Gaussian model leads to ef\ufb01cient algorithms for inference and learning, it also implies that the marginal distribution of the observed variables is simply a Gaussian, which represents a signi\ufb01cant limitation. One simple extension of the linear dynamical system is to use a Gaussian mixture as the initial distribution for z1. If this mixture has K components, then the forward recursion equations (13.85) will lead to a mixture of K Gaussians over each hidden variable zn, and so the model is again tractable. For many applications, the Gaussian emission density is a poor approximation. If instead we try to use a mixture of K Gaussians as the emission density, then the posterior \u0001\u03b1(z1) will also be a mixture of K Gaussians. However, from (13.85) the posterior \u0001\u03b1(z2) will comprise a mixture of K2 Gaussians, and so on, with \u0001\u03b1(zn) being given by a mixture of Kn Gaussians. Thus the number of components grows exponentially with the length of the chain, and so this model is impractical. More generally, introducing transition or emission models that depart from the linear-Gaussian (or other exponential family) model leads to an intractable infer- ence problem. We can make deterministic approximations such as assumed den- sity \ufb01ltering or expectation propagation, or we can make use of sampling methods, Chapter 10 as discussed in Section 13.3.4. One widely used approach is to make a Gaussian approximation by linearizing around the mean of the predicted distribution, which gives rise to the extended Kalman \ufb01lter (Zarchan and Musoff, 2005). As with hidden Markov models, we can develop interesting extensions of the ba- sic linear dynamical system by expanding its graphical representation. For example, the switching state space model (Ghahramani and Hinton, 1998) can be viewed as a combination of the hidden Markov model with a set of linear dynamical systems. The model has multiple Markov chains of continuous linear-Gaussian latent vari- ables, each of which is analogous to the latent chain of the linear dynamical system discussed earlier, together with a Markov chain of discrete variables of the form used in a hidden Markov model. The output at each time step is determined by stochas- tically choosing one of the continuous latent chains, using the state of the discrete latent variable as a switch, and then emitting an observation from the corresponding conditional output distribution. Exact inference in this model is intractable, but vari- ational methods lead to an ef\ufb01cient inference scheme involving forward-backward recursions along each of the continuous and discrete Markov chains independently. Note that, if we consider multiple chains of discrete latent variables, and use one as the switch to select from the remainder, we obtain an analogous model having only discrete latent variables known as the switching hidden Markov model.",

It is often found that improved performance can be obtained by combining multiple models together in some way, instead of just using a single model in isolation. For instance, we might train L different models and then make predictions using the average of the predictions made by each model. Such combinations of models are sometimes called committees. In Section 14.2, we dis- cuss ways to apply the committee concept in practice, and we also give some insight into why it can sometimes be an effective procedure. One important variant of the committee method, known as boosting, involves training multiple models in sequence in which the error function used to train a par- ticular model depends on the performance of the previous models.

Thus different models be- come responsible for making predictions in different regions of input space. One widely used framework of this kind is known as a decision tree in which the selec- tion process can be described as a sequence of binary selections corresponding to the traversal of a tree structure and is discussed in Section 14.4. In this case, the individual models are generally chosen to be very simple, and the overall \ufb02exibility of the model arises from the input-dependent selection process. Decision trees can be applied to both classi\ufb01cation and regression problems. One limitation of decision trees is that the division of input space is based on hard splits in which only one model is responsible for making predictions for any given value of the input variables. The decision process can be softened by moving to a probabilistic framework for combining models, as discussed in Section 14.5. For example, if we have a set of K models for a conditional distribution p(t|x, k) where x is the input variable, t is the target variable, and k = 1, . . . , K indexes the model, then we can form a probabilistic mixture of the form p(t|x) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0k(x)p(t|x, k) (14.1) in which \u03c0k(x) = p(k|x) represent the input-dependent mixing coef\ufb01cients. Such models can be viewed as mixture distributions in which the component densities, as well as the mixing coef\ufb01cients, are conditioned on the input variables and are known as mixtures of experts. They are closely related to the mixture density network model discussed in Section 5.6. 14.1. Bayesian Model Averaging It is important to distinguish between model combination methods and Bayesian model averaging, as the two are often confused. To understand the difference, con- sider the example of density estimation using a mixture of Gaussians in which several Section 9.2 Gaussian components are combined probabilistically. The model contains a binary latent variable z that indicates which component of the mixture is responsible for generating the corresponding data point. Thus the model is speci\ufb01ed in terms of a joint distribution p(x, z) (14.2) and the corresponding density over the observed variable x is obtained by marginal- izing over the latent variable p(x) = \u0002 z p(x, z).

Committees 655 In the case of our Gaussian mixture example, this leads to a distribution of the form p(x) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0kN(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) (14.4) with the usual interpretation of the symbols. This is an example of model combi- nation. For independent, identically distributed data, we can use (14.3) to write the marginal probability of a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN} in the form p(X) = N \u000e n=1 p(xn) = N \u000e n=1 \u0002 zn p(xn, zn) . (14.5) Thus we see that each observed data point xn has a corresponding latent variable zn. Now suppose we have several different models indexed by h = 1, . . . , H with prior probabilities p(h). For instance one model might be a mixture of Gaussians and another model might be a mixture of Cauchy distributions. The marginal distribution over the data set is given by p(X) = H \u0002 h=1 p(X|h)p(h). (14.6) This is an example of Bayesian model averaging. The interpretation of this summa- tion over h is that just one model is responsible for generating the whole data set, and the probability distribution over h simply re\ufb02ects our uncertainty as to which model that is. As the size of the data set increases, this uncertainty reduces, and the posterior probabilities p(h|X) become increasingly focussed on just one of the models. This highlights the key difference between Bayesian model averaging and model combination, because in Bayesian model averaging the whole data set is generated by a single model. By contrast, when we combine multiple models, as in (14.5), we see that different data points within the data set can potentially be generated from different values of the latent variable z and hence by different components. Although we have considered the marginal probability p(X), the same consid- erations apply for the predictive density p(x|X) or for conditional distributions such as p(t|x, X, T). Exercise 14.1 14.2. Committees The simplest way to construct a committee is to average the predictions of a set of individual models. Such a procedure can be motivated from a frequentist perspective by considering the trade-off between bias and variance, which decomposes the er- Section 3.2 ror due to a model into the bias component that arises from differences between the model and the true function to be predicted, and the variance component that repre- sents the sensitivity of the model to the individual data points.

COMBINING MODELS that when we trained multiple polynomials using the sinusoidal data, and then aver- aged the resulting functions, the contribution arising from the variance term tended to cancel, leading to improved predictions. When we averaged a set of low-bias mod- els (corresponding to higher order polynomials), we obtained accurate predictions for the underlying sinusoidal function from which the data were generated. In practice, of course, we have only a single data set, and so we have to \ufb01nd a way to introduce variability between the different models within the committee. One approach is to use bootstrap data sets, discussed in Section 1.2.3. Consider a regression problem in which we are trying to predict the value of a single continuous variable, and suppose we generate M bootstrap data sets and then use each to train a separate copy ym(x) of a predictive model where m = 1, . . . , M. The committee prediction is given by yCOM(x) = 1 M M \u0002 m=1 ym(x). (14.7) This procedure is known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging (Breiman, 1996). Suppose the true regression function that we are trying to predict is given by h(x), so that the output of each of the models can be written as the true value plus an error in the form ym(x) = h(x) + \u03f5m(x). (14.8) The average sum-of-squares error then takes the form Ex \b {ym(x) \u2212h(x)}2 = Ex \b \u03f5m(x)2 (14.9) where Ex[\u00b7] denotes a frequentist expectation with respect to the distribution of the input vector x. The average error made by the models acting individually is therefore EAV = 1 M M \u0002 m=1 Ex \b \u03f5m(x)2 .

(14.14) This apparently dramatic result suggests that the average error of a model can be reduced by a factor of M simply by averaging M versions of the model. Unfortu- nately, it depends on the key assumption that the errors due to the individual models are uncorrelated. In practice, the errors are typically highly correlated, and the reduc- tion in overall error is generally small. It can, however, be shown that the expected committee error will not exceed the expected error of the constituent models, so that ECOM \u2a7dEAV. In order to achieve more signi\ufb01cant improvements, we turn to a more Exercise 14.3 sophisticated technique for building committees, known as boosting. 14.3. Boosting Boosting is a powerful technique for combining multiple \u2018base\u2019 classi\ufb01ers to produce a form of committee whose performance can be signi\ufb01cantly better than that of any of the base classi\ufb01ers. Here we describe the most widely used form of boosting algorithm called AdaBoost, short for \u2018adaptive boosting\u2019, developed by Freund and Schapire (1996). Boosting can give good results even if the base classi\ufb01ers have a performance that is only slightly better than random, and hence sometimes the base classi\ufb01ers are known as weak learners. Originally designed for solving classi\ufb01cation problems, boosting can also be extended to regression (Friedman, 2001). The principal difference between boosting and the committee methods such as bagging discussed above, is that the base classi\ufb01ers are trained in sequence, and each base classi\ufb01er is trained using a weighted form of the data set in which the weighting coef\ufb01cient associated with each data point depends on the performance of the previous classi\ufb01ers. In particular, points that are misclassi\ufb01ed by one of the base classi\ufb01ers are given greater weight when used to train the next classi\ufb01er in the sequence. Once all the classi\ufb01ers have been trained, their predictions are then combined through a weighted majority voting scheme, as illustrated schematically in Figure 14.1. Consider a two-class classi\ufb01cation problem, in which the training data comprises input vectors x1, . . . , xN along with corresponding binary target variables t1, . . . , tN where tn \u2208{\u22121, 1}. Each data point is given an associated weighting parameter wn, which is initially set 1/N for all data points. We shall suppose that we have a procedure available for training a base classi\ufb01er using weighted data to give a function y(x) \u2208{\u22121, 1}. At each stage of the algorithm, AdaBoost trains a new classi\ufb01er using a data set in which the weighting coef\ufb01cients are adjusted according to the performance of the previously trained classi\ufb01er so as to give greater weight to the misclassi\ufb01ed data points. Finally, when the desired number of base classi\ufb01ers have been trained, they are combined to form a committee using coef\ufb01cients that give different weight to different base classi\ufb01ers. The precise form of the AdaBoost algorithm is given below.",

(14.19) We see that the \ufb01rst base classi\ufb01er y1(x) is trained using weighting coef\ufb01- cients w(1) n that are all equal, which therefore corresponds to the usual procedure for training a single classi\ufb01er. From (14.18), we see that in subsequent iterations the weighting coef\ufb01cients w(m) n are increased for data points that are misclassi\ufb01ed and decreased for data points that are correctly classi\ufb01ed. Successive classi\ufb01ers are therefore forced to place greater emphasis on points that have been misclassi\ufb01ed by previous classi\ufb01ers, and data points that continue to be misclassi\ufb01ed by successive classi\ufb01ers receive ever greater weight. The quantities \u03f5m represent weighted mea- sures of the error rates of each of the base classi\ufb01ers on the data set.

This simple classi\ufb01er corresponds to a form of decision tree known as a \u2018decision stumps\u2019, i.e., a deci- Section 14.4 sion tree with a single node.

However, these bounds turn out to be too loose to have practical value, and the actual performance of boosting is much better than the bounds alone would suggest. Friedman et al.

(14.24) Making use of the fact that tnym(xn) = 1 \u22122I(ym(xn) \u0338= tn) (14.25) we see that the weights w(m) n are updated at the next iteration using w(m+1) n = w(m) n exp(\u2212\u03b1m/2) exp {\u03b1mI(ym(xn) \u0338= tn)} . (14.26) Because the term exp(\u2212\u03b1m/2) is independent of n, we see that it weights all data points by the same factor and so can be discarded. Thus we obtain (14.18).

Thus the AdaBoost algorithm is seeking the best approx- imation to the log odds ratio, within the space of functions represented by the linear combination of base classi\ufb01ers, subject to the constrained minimization resulting from the sequential optimization strategy. This result motivates the use of the sign function in (14.19) to arrive at the \ufb01nal classi\ufb01cation decision. We have already seen that the minimizer y(x) of the cross-entropy error (4.90) for two-class classi\ufb01cation is given by the posterior class probability. In the case of a target variable t \u2208{\u22121, 1}, we have seen that the error function is given by Section 7.1.2 ln(1 + exp(\u2212yt)). This is compared with the exponential error function in Fig- ure 14.3, where we have divided the cross-entropy error by a constant factor ln(2) so that it passes through the point (0, 1) for ease of comparison. We see that both can be seen as continuous approximations to the ideal misclassi\ufb01cation error func- tion. An advantage of the exponential error is that its sequential minimization leads to the simple AdaBoost scheme. One drawback, however, is that it penalizes large negative values of ty(x) much more strongly than cross-entropy. In particular, we see that for large negative values of ty, the cross-entropy grows linearly with |ty|, whereas the exponential error function grows exponentially with |ty|. Thus the ex- ponential error function will be much less robust to outliers or misclassi\ufb01ed data points. Another important difference between cross-entropy and the exponential er- ror function is that the latter cannot be interpreted as the log likelihood function of any well-de\ufb01ned probabilistic model. Furthermore, the exponential error does not Exercise 14.8 generalize to classi\ufb01cation problems having K > 2 classes, again in contrast to the cross-entropy for a probabilistic model, which is easily generalized to give (4.108). Section 4.3.4 The interpretation of boosting as the sequential optimization of an additive model under an exponential error (Friedman et al., 2000) opens the door to a wide range of boosting-like algorithms, including multiclass extensions, by altering the choice of error function. It also motivates the extension to regression problems (Friedman, 2001). If we consider a sum-of-squares error function for regression, then sequential minimization of an additive model of the form (14.21) simply involves \ufb01tting each new base classi\ufb01er to the residual errors tn\u2212fm\u22121(xn) from the previous model. As Exercise 14.9 we have noted, however, the sum-of-squares error is not robust to outliers, and this",

These two error functions are compared in Figure 14.4. 14.4. Tree-based Models There are various simple, but widely used, models that work by partitioning the input space into cuboid regions, whose edges are aligned with the axes, and then assigning a simple model (for example, a constant) to each region. They can be viewed as a model combination method in which only one model is responsible for making predictions at any given point in input space. The process of selecting a speci\ufb01c model, given a new input x, can be described by a sequential decision making process corresponding to the traversal of a binary tree (one that splits into two branches at each node). Here we focus on a particular tree-based framework called classi\ufb01cation and regression trees, or CART (Breiman et al., 1984), although there are many other variants going by such names as ID3 and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1986; Quinlan, 1993).

This creates two subregions, each of which can then be subdivided independently. For instance, the region x1 \u2a7d\u03b81 is further subdivided according to whether x2 \u2a7d\u03b82 or x2 > \u03b82, giving rise to the regions denoted A and B. The recursive subdivision can be described by the traversal of the binary tree shown in Figure 14.6. For any new input x, we determine which region it falls into by starting at the top of the tree at the root node and following a path down to a speci\ufb01c leaf node according to the decision criteria at each node. Note that such decision trees are not probabilistic graphical models. Within each region, there is a separate model to predict the target variable. For instance, in regression we might simply predict a constant over each region, or in classi\ufb01cation we might assign each region to a speci\ufb01c class. A key property of tree- based models, which makes them popular in \ufb01elds such as medical diagnosis, for example, is that they are readily interpretable by humans because they correspond to a sequence of binary decisions applied to the individual input variables. For in- stance, to predict a patient\u2019s disease, we might \ufb01rst ask \u201cis their temperature greater than some threshold?\u201d. If the answer is yes, then we might next ask \u201cis their blood pressure less than some threshold?\u201d. Each leaf of the tree is then associated with a speci\ufb01c diagnosis. In order to learn such a model from a training set, we have to determine the structure of the tree, including which input variable is chosen at each node to form the split criterion as well as the value of the threshold parameter \u03b8i for the split. We also have to determine the values of the predictive variable within each region. Consider \ufb01rst a regression problem in which the goal is to predict a single target variable t from a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T of input variables. The training data consists of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along with the corresponding continuous labels {t1, . . . , tN}. If the partitioning of the input space is given, and we minimize the sum-of-squares error function, then the optimal value of the predictive variable within any given region is just given by the average of the values of tn for those data points that fall in that region. Exercise 14.10 Now consider how to determine the structure of the decision tree. Even for a \ufb01xed number of nodes in the tree, the problem of determining the optimal structure (including choice of input variable for each split as well as the corresponding thresh-",

Instead, a greedy opti- mization is generally done by starting with a single root node, corresponding to the whole input space, and then growing the tree by adding nodes one at a time. At each step there will be some number of candidate regions in input space that can be split, corresponding to the addition of a pair of leaf nodes to the existing tree. For each of these, there is a choice of which of the D input variables to split, as well as the value of the threshold. The joint optimization of the choice of region to split, and the choice of input variable and threshold, can be done ef\ufb01ciently by exhaustive search noting that, for a given choice of split variable and threshold, the optimal choice of predictive variable is given by the local average of the data, as noted earlier. This is repeated for all possible choices of variable to be split, and the one that gives the smallest residual sum-of-squares error is retained. Given a greedy strategy for growing the tree, there remains the issue of when to stop adding nodes. A simple approach would be to stop when the reduction in residual error falls below some threshold. However, it is found empirically that often none of the available splits produces a signi\ufb01cant reduction in error, and yet after several more splits a substantial error reduction is found. For this reason, it is com- mon practice to grow a large tree, using a stopping criterion based on the number of data points associated with the leaf nodes, and then prune back the resulting tree. The pruning is based on a criterion that balances residual error against a measure of model complexity. If we denote the starting tree for pruning by T0, then we de\ufb01ne T \u2282T0 to be a subtree of T0 if it can be obtained by pruning nodes from T0 (in other words, by collapsing internal nodes by combining the corresponding regions). Suppose the leaf nodes are indexed by \u03c4 = 1, . . . , |T|, with leaf node \u03c4 representing a region R\u03c4 of input space having N\u03c4 data points, and |T| denoting the total number of leaf nodes. The optimal prediction for region R\u03c4 is then given by y\u03c4 = 1 N\u03c4 \u0002 xn\u2208R\u03c4 tn (14.29) and the corresponding contribution to the residual sum-of-squares is then Q\u03c4(T) = \u0002 xn\u2208R\u03c4 {tn \u2212y\u03c4}2 . (14.30) The pruning criterion is then given by C(T) = |T | \u0002 \u03c4=1 Q\u03c4(T) + \u03bb|T| (14.31) The regularization parameter \u03bb determines the trade-off between the overall residual sum-of-squares error and the complexity of the model as measured by the number |T| of leaf nodes, and its value is chosen by cross-validation. For classi\ufb01cation problems, the process of growing and pruning the tree is sim- ilar, except that the sum-of-squares error is replaced by a more appropriate measure",

If we de\ufb01ne p\u03c4k to be the proportion of data points in region R\u03c4 assigned to class k, where k = 1, . . . , K, then two commonly used choices are the cross-entropy Q\u03c4(T) = K \u0002 k=1 p\u03c4k ln p\u03c4k (14.32) and the Gini index Q\u03c4(T) = K \u0002 k=1 p\u03c4k (1 \u2212p\u03c4k) . (14.33) These both vanish for p\u03c4k = 0 and p\u03c4k = 1 and have a maximum at p\u03c4k = 0.5. They encourage the formation of regions in which a high proportion of the data points are assigned to one class. The cross entropy and the Gini index are better measures than the misclassi\ufb01cation rate for growing the tree because they are more sensitive to the node probabilities. Also, unlike misclassi\ufb01cation rate, they are differentiable and Exercise 14.11 hence better suited to gradient based optimization methods. For subsequent pruning of the tree, the misclassi\ufb01cation rate is generally used. The human interpretability of a tree model such as CART is often seen as its major strength. However, in practice it is found that the particular tree structure that is learned is very sensitive to the details of the data set, so that a small change to the training data can result in a very different set of splits (Hastie et al., 2001). There are other problems with tree-based methods of the kind considered in this section. One is that the splits are aligned with the axes of the feature space, which may be very suboptimal. For instance, to separate two classes whose optimal decision boundary runs at 45 degrees to the axes would need a large number of axis-parallel splits of the input space as compared to a single non-axis-aligned split. Furthermore, the splits in a decision tree are hard, so that each region of input space is associated with one, and only one, leaf node model. The last issue is particularly problematic in regression where we are typically aiming to model smooth functions, and yet the tree model produces piecewise-constant predictions with discontinuities at the split boundaries. 14.5. Conditional Mixture Models We have seen that standard decision trees are restricted by hard, axis-aligned splits of the input space. These constraints can be relaxed, at the expense of interpretability, by allowing soft, probabilistic splits that can be functions of all of the input variables, not just one of them at a time. If we also give the leaf models a probabilistic inter- pretation, we arrive at a fully probabilistic tree-based model called the hierarchical mixture of experts, which we consider in Section 14.5.3. An alternative way to motivate the hierarchical mixture of experts model is to start with a standard probabilistic mixtures of unconditional density models such as Gaussians and replace the component densities with conditional distributions. Here Chapter 9 we consider mixtures of linear regression models (Section 14.5.1) and mixtures of",

If we make a further generalization to allow the mixing coef\ufb01cients also to depend on the inputs then we obtain a mixture of experts model. Finally, if we allow each component in the mixture model to be itself a mixture of experts model, then we obtain a hierarchical mixture of experts. 14.5.1 Mixtures of linear regression models One of the many advantages of giving a probabilistic interpretation to the lin- ear regression model is that it can then be used as a component in more complex probabilistic models. This can be done, for instance, by viewing the conditional distribution representing the linear regression model as a node in a directed prob- abilistic graph. Here we consider a simple example corresponding to a mixture of linear regression models, which represents a straightforward extension of the Gaus- sian mixture model discussed in Section 9.2 to the case of conditional Gaussian distributions. We therefore consider K linear regression models, each governed by its own weight parameter wk. In many applications, it will be appropriate to use a common noise variance, governed by a precision parameter \u03b2, for all K components, and this is the case we consider here. We will once again restrict attention to a single target variable t, though the extension to multiple outputs is straightforward. If we denote Exercise 14.12 the mixing coef\ufb01cients by \u03c0k, then the mixture distribution can be written p(t|\u03b8) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0kN(t|wT k \u03c6, \u03b2\u22121) (14.34) where \u03b8 denotes the set of all adaptive parameters in the model, namely W = {wk}, \u03c0 = {\u03c0k}, and \u03b2. The log likelihood function for this model, given a data set of observations {\u03c6n, tn}, then takes the form ln p(t|\u03b8) = N \u0002 n=1 ln \u0016 K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0kN(tn|wT k \u03c6n, \u03b2\u22121) \u0017 (14.35) where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T denotes the vector of target variables. In order to maximize this likelihood function, we can once again appeal to the EM algorithm, which will turn out to be a simple extension of the EM algorithm for unconditional Gaussian mixtures of Section 9.2. We can therefore build on our expe- rience with the unconditional mixture and introduce a set Z = {zn} of binary latent variables where znk \u2208{0, 1} in which, for each data point n, all of the elements k = 1, . . . , K are zero except for a single value of 1 indicating which component of the mixture was responsible for generating that data point. The joint distribution over latent and observed variables can be represented by the graphical model shown in Figure 14.7. The complete-data log likelihood function then takes the form Exercise 14.13 ln p(t, Z|\u03b8) = N \u0002 n=1 K \u0002 k=1 znk ln \u001a \u03c0kN(tn|wT k \u03c6n, \u03b2\u22121) \u001b . (14.36)",

Substituting for the Gaussian distribution, we see that the function Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old), as a function of the parameter vector wk, takes the form Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = N \u0002 n=1 \u03b3nk \u2212\u03b2 2 tn \u2212wT k \u03c6n 2 + const (14.39) where the constant term includes the contributions from other weight vectors wj for j \u0338= k.

(14.44) In Figure 14.8, we illustrate this EM algorithm using the simple example of \ufb01tting a mixture of two straight lines to a data set having one input variable x and one target variable t. The predictive density (14.34) is plotted in Figure 14.9 using the converged parameter values obtained from the EM algorithm, corresponding to the right-hand plot in Figure 14.8. Also shown in this \ufb01gure is the result of \ufb01tting a single linear regression model, which gives a unimodal predictive density. We see that the mixture model gives a much better representation of the data distribution, and this is re\ufb02ected in the higher likelihood value. However, the mixture model also assigns signi\ufb01cant probability mass to regions where there is no data because its predictive distribution is bimodal for all values of x. This problem can be resolved by extending the model to allow the mixture coef\ufb01cients themselves to be functions of x, leading to models such as the mixture density networks discussed in Section 5.6, and hierarchical mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3.",

This example involves a straightforward combination of ideas encountered in earlier sections of the book and will help consolidate these for the reader.

(14.50) To determine the {wk}, we note that the Q(\u03b8, \u03b8old) function comprises a sum over terms indexed by k each of which depends only on one of the vectors wk, so that the different vectors are decoupled in the M step of the EM algorithm. In other words, the different components interact only via the responsibilities, which are \ufb01xed during the M step. Note that the M step does not have a closed-form solution and must be solved iteratively using, for instance, the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. The gradient and the Hessian for the vector wk are given by Section 4.3.3 \u2207kQ = N \u0002 n=1 \u03b3nk(tn \u2212ynk)\u03c6n (14.51) Hk = \u2212\u2207k\u2207kQ = N \u0002 n=1 \u03b3nkynk(1 \u2212ynk)\u03c6n\u03c6T n (14.52) where \u2207k denotes the gradient with respect to wk. For \ufb01xed \u03b3nk, these are indepen- dent of {wj} for j \u0338= k and so we can solve for each wk separately using the IRLS algorithm. Thus the M-step equations for component k correspond simply to \ufb01tting Section 4.3.3 a single logistic regression model to a weighted data set in which data point n carries a weight \u03b3nk.

The extension of this model to a mixture of softmax models for more than two classes is straightforward. Exercise 14.16 14.5.3 Mixtures of experts In Section 14.5.1, we considered a mixture of linear regression models, and in Section 14.5.2 we discussed the analogous mixture of linear classi\ufb01ers. Although these simple mixtures extend the \ufb02exibility of linear models to include more com- plex (e.g., multimodal) predictive distributions, they are still very limited. We can further increase the capability of such models by allowing the mixing coef\ufb01cients themselves to be functions of the input variable, so that p(t|x) = K \u0002 k=1 \u03c0k(x)pk(t|x). (14.53) This is known as a mixture of experts model (Jacobs et al., 1991) in which the mix- ing coef\ufb01cients \u03c0k(x) are known as gating functions and the individual component densities pk(t|x) are called experts.

The centre plot shows the result of \ufb01tting a single logistic regression model using maximum likelihood, in which the background colour denotes the corresponding probability of the class label. Because the colour is a near-uniform purple, we see that the model assigns a probability of around 0.5 to each of the classes over most of input space.

The gating functions \u03c0k(x) must satisfy the usual constraints for mixing co- ef\ufb01cients, namely 0 \u2a7d\u03c0k(x) \u2a7d1 and \u0005 k \u03c0k(x) = 1. They can therefore be represented, for example, by linear softmax models of the form (4.104) and (4.105). If the experts are also linear (regression or classi\ufb01cation) models, then the whole model can be \ufb01tted ef\ufb01ciently using the EM algorithm, with iterative reweighted least squares being employed in the M step (Jordan and Jacobs, 1994). Such a model still has signi\ufb01cant limitations due to the use of linear models for the gating and expert functions. A much more \ufb02exible model is obtained by using a multilevel gating function to give the hierarchical mixture of experts, or HME model (Jordan and Jacobs, 1994). To understand the structure of this model, imagine a mixture distribution in which each component in the mixture is itself a mixture distribution. For simple unconditional mixtures, this hierarchical mixture is trivially equivalent to a single \ufb02at mixture distribution. However, when the mixing Exercise 14.17 coef\ufb01cients are input dependent, this hierarchical model becomes nontrivial. The HME model can also be viewed as a probabilistic version of decision trees discussed in Section 14.4 and can again be trained ef\ufb01ciently by maximum likelihood using an EM algorithm with IRLS in the M step. A Bayesian treatment of the HME has been Section 4.3.3 given by Bishop and Svens\u00b4en (2003) based on variational inference. We shall not discuss the HME in detail here. However, it is worth pointing out the close connection with the mixture density network discussed in Section 5.6. The principal advantage of the mixtures of experts model is that it can be optimized by EM in which the M step for each mixture component and gating model involves a convex optimization (although the overall optimization is nonconvex). By con- trast, the advantage of the mixture density network approach is that the component",

Oil Flow This is a synthetic data set that arose out of a project aimed at measuring nonin- vasively the proportions of oil, water, and gas in North Sea oil transfer pipelines (Bishop and James, 1993). It is based on the principle of dual-energy gamma densit- ometry. The ideas is that if a narrow beam of gamma rays is passed through the pipe, the attenuation in the intensity of the beam provides information about the density of material along its path. Thus, for instance, the beam will be attenuated more strongly by oil than by gas. A single attenuation measurement alone is not suf\ufb01cient because there are two degrees of freedom corresponding to the fraction of oil and the fraction of water (the fraction of gas is redundant because the three fractions must add to one). To address this, two gamma beams of different energies (in other words different frequencies or wavelengths) are passed through the pipe along the same path, and the attenuation of each is measured. Because the absorbtion properties of different materials vary dif- ferently as a function of energy, measurement of the attenuations at the two energies provides two independent pieces of information. Given the known absorbtion prop- erties of oil, water, and gas at the two energies, it is then a simple matter to calculate the average fractions of oil and water (and hence of gas) measured along the path of the gamma beams. There is a further complication, however, associated with the motion of the ma- terials along the pipe. If the \ufb02ow velocity is small, then the oil \ufb02oats on top of the water with the gas sitting above the oil. This is known as a laminar or strati\ufb01ed",

These con\ufb01gurations are also illustrated in Figure A.2. We have seen that a single dual-energy beam gives the oil and water fractions measured along the path length, whereas we are interested in the volume fractions of oil and water. This can be addressed by using multiple dual-energy gamma densit- ometers whose beams pass through different regions of the pipe.

On the other hand the range of geometrical con\ufb01gurations is much more limited, and so the con\ufb01guration, as well as the phase fractions, can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from the densitometer data. For safety reasons, the intensity of the gamma beams is kept relatively weak and so to obtain an accurate measurement of the attenuation, the measured beam intensity is integrated over a speci\ufb01c time interval. For a \ufb01nite integration time, there are random \ufb02uctuations in the measured intensity due to the fact that the gamma beams comprise discrete packets of energy called photons. In practice, the integration time is chosen as a compromise between reducing the noise level (which requires a long integration time) and detecting temporal variations in the \ufb02ow (which requires a short integration time). The oil \ufb02ow data set is generated using realistic known values for the absorption properties of oil, water, and gas at the two gamma energies used, and with a speci\ufb01c choice of integration time (10 seconds) chosen as characteristic of a typical practical setup. Each point in the data set is generated independently using the following steps: 1. Choose one of the three phase con\ufb01gurations at random with equal probability. 2.

The data set is divided into training, validation, and test sets, each of which comprises 1, 000 independent data points. Details of the data format are available from the book web site. In Bishop and James (1993), statistical machine learning techniques were used to predict the volume fractions and also the geometrical con\ufb01guration of the phases shown in Figure A.2, from the 12-dimensional vector of measurements. The 12- dimensional observation vectors can also be used to test data visualization algo- rithms. This data set has a rich and interesting structure, as follows.

For a \ufb01nite integration time, the individual data points will be perturbed away from the manifold by the photon noise. In the homogeneous phase con\ufb01guration, the path lengths in oil and water are linearly related to the fractions of oil and water, and so the data points lie close to a linear manifold. For the annular con\ufb01guration, the relationship between phase fraction and path length is nonlinear and so the manifold will be nonlinear. In the case of the laminar con\ufb01guration the situation is even more complex because small variations in the phase fractions can cause one of the horizontal phase boundaries to move across one of the horizontal beam lines leading to a discontinuous jump in the 12-dimensional observation space. In this way, the two-dimensional nonlinear manifold for the laminar con\ufb01guration is broken into six distinct segments. Note also that some of the manifolds for different phase con\ufb01gurations meet at speci\ufb01c points, for example if the pipe is \ufb01lled entirely with oil, it corresponds to speci\ufb01c instances of the laminar, annular, and homoge- neous con\ufb01gurations. Old Faithful Old Faithful, shown in Figure A.4, is a hydrothermal geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the state of Wyoming, U.S.A., and is a popular tourist attraction. Its name stems from the supposed regularity of its eruptions. The data set comprises 272 observations, each of which represents a single erup- tion and contains two variables corresponding to the duration in minutes of the erup- tion, and the time until the next eruption, also in minutes. Figure A.5 shows a plot of the time to the next eruption versus the duration of the eruptions. It can be seen that the time to the next eruption varies considerably, although knowledge of the duration of the current eruption allows it to be predicted more accurately. Note that there exist several other data sets relating to the eruptions of Old Faithful. Figure A.4 The Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. c\u20ddBruce T.

The input values {xn} are generated uniformly in range (0, 1), and the corresponding target values {tn} are obtained by \ufb01rst computing the corresponding values of the function sin(2\u03c0x), and then adding random noise with a Gaussian distribution having standard deviation 0.3. Various forms of this data set, having different numbers of data points, are used in the book. The second data set is a classi\ufb01cation problem having two classes, with equal prior probabilities, and is shown in Figure A.7. The blue class is generated from a single Gaussian while the red class comes from a mixture of two Gaussians. Be- cause we know the class priors and the class-conditional densities, it is straightfor- ward to evaluate and plot the true posterior probabilities as well as the minimum misclassi\ufb01cation-rate decision boundary, as shown in Figure A.7.",

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS 693 Von Mises The von Mises distribution, also known as the circular normal or the circular Gaus- sian, is a univariate Gaussian-like periodic distribution for a variable \u03b8 \u2208[0, 2\u03c0). p(\u03b8|\u03b80, m) = 1 2\u03c0I0(m) exp {m cos(\u03b8 \u2212\u03b80)} (B.77) where I0(m) is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the \ufb01rst kind. The distribution has period 2\u03c0 so that p(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = p(\u03b8) for all \u03b8. Care must be taken in interpret- ing this distribution because simple expectations will be dependent on the (arbitrary) choice of origin for the variable \u03b8. The parameter \u03b80 is analogous to the mean of a univariate Gaussian, and the parameter m > 0, known as the concentration param- eter, is analogous to the precision (inverse variance). For large m, the von Mises distribution is approximately a Gaussian centred on \u03b80. Wishart The Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior for the precision matrix of a multi- variate Gaussian.

This is not intended to be an introductory tutorial, and it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with basic linear algebra. For some results, we indicate how to prove them, whereas in more complex cases we leave the interested reader to refer to standard textbooks on the subject. In all cases, we assume that inverses exist and that matrix dimensions are such that the formulae are correctly de\ufb01ned. A comprehensive discussion of linear algebra can be found in Golub and Van Loan (1996), and an extensive collection of matrix properties is given by L\u00a8utkepohl (1996). Matrix derivatives are discussed in Magnus and Neudecker (1999). Basic Matrix Identities A matrix A has elements Aij where i indexes the rows, and j indexes the columns. We use IN to denote the N \u00d7 N identity matrix (also called the unit matrix), and where there is no ambiguity over dimensionality we simply use I. The transpose matrix AT has elements (AT)ij = Aji. From the de\ufb01nition of transpose, we have (AB)T = BTAT (C.1) which can be veri\ufb01ed by writing out the indices.

Then if M \u226aN, it will be much cheaper to evaluate the right-hand side of (C.5) than the left-hand side. A special case that sometimes arises is (I + AB)\u22121A = A(I + BA)\u22121. (C.6) Another useful identity involving inverses is the following: (A + BD\u22121C)\u22121 = A\u22121 \u2212A\u22121B(D + CA\u22121B)\u22121CA\u22121 (C.7) which is known as the Woodbury identity and which can be veri\ufb01ed by multiplying both sides by (A + BD\u22121C). This is useful, for instance, when A is large and diagonal, and hence easy to invert, while B has many rows but few columns (and conversely for C) so that the right-hand side is much cheaper to evaluate than the left-hand side. A set of vectors {a1, . . . , aN} is said to be linearly independent if the relation \u0005 n \u03b1nan = 0 holds only if all \u03b1n = 0. This implies that none of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the remainder. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or equivalently the maximum number of linearly independent columns). Traces and Determinants Trace and determinant apply to square matrices. The trace Tr(A) of a matrix A is de\ufb01ned as the sum of the elements on the leading diagonal. By writing out the indices, we see that Tr(AB) = Tr(BA). (C.8) By applying this formula multiple times to the product of three matrices, we see that Tr(ABC) = Tr(CAB) = Tr(BCA) (C.9) which is known as the cyclic property of the trace operator and which clearly extends to the product of any number of matrices.

Because this is a polynomial of order M in \u03bbi, it must have M solutions (though these need not all be distinct). The rank of A is equal to the number of nonzero eigenvalues. Of particular interest are symmetric matrices, which arise as covariance ma- trices, kernel matrices, and Hessians. Symmetric matrices have the property that Aij = Aji, or equivalently AT = A. The inverse of a symmetric matrix is also sym- metric, as can be seen by taking the transpose of A\u22121A = I and using AA\u22121 = I together with the symmetry of I. In general, the eigenvalues of a matrix are complex numbers, but for symmetric matrices the eigenvalues \u03bbi are real.

Because there are M eigenvalues, the corresponding M orthogonal eigenvectors form a complete set and so any M-dimensional vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. We can take the eigenvectors ui to be the columns of an M \u00d7 M matrix U, which from orthonormality satis\ufb01es UTU = I. (C.37) Such a matrix is said to be orthogonal. Interestingly, the rows of this matrix are also orthogonal, so that UUT = I. To show this, note that (C.37) implies UTUU\u22121 = U\u22121 = UT and so UU\u22121 = UUT = I. Using (C.12), it also follows that |U| = 1.

In the same way, we can de\ufb01ne a functional F[y] to be an operator that takes a function y(x) and returns an output value F. An example of a functional is the length of a curve drawn in a two-dimensional plane in which the path of the curve is de\ufb01ned in terms of a function. In the context of machine learning, a widely used functional is the entropy H[x] for a continuous variable x because, for any choice of probability density function p(x), it returns a scalar value representing the entropy of x under that density. Thus the entropy of p(x) could equally well have been written as H[p]. A common problem in conventional calculus is to \ufb01nd a value of x that max- imizes (or minimizes) a function y(x). Similarly, in the calculus of variations we seek a function y(x) that maximizes (or minimizes) a functional F[y]. That is, of all possible functions y(x), we wish to \ufb01nd the particular function for which the func- tional F[y] is a maximum (or minimum). The calculus of variations can be used, for instance, to show that the shortest path between two points is a straight line or that the maximum entropy distribution is a Gaussian.

(D.4) Because this must hold for an arbitrary choice of \u03b7(x), it follows that the functional derivative must vanish. To see this, imagine choosing a perturbation \u03b7(x) that is zero everywhere except in the neighbourhood of a point \u0001x, in which case the functional derivative must be zero at x = \u0001x. However, because this must be true for every choice of \u0001x, the functional derivative must vanish for all values of x. Consider a functional that is de\ufb01ned by an integral over a function G(y, y\u2032, x) that depends on both y(x) and its derivative y\u2032(x) as well as having a direct depen- dence on x F[y] = \u0006 G (y(x), y\u2032(x), x) dx (D.5) where the value of y(x) is assumed to be \ufb01xed at the boundary of the region of integration (which might be at in\ufb01nity).

Consider the problem of \ufb01nding the maximum of a function f(x1, x2) subject to a constraint relating x1 and x2, which we write in the form g(x1, x2) = 0. (E.1) One approach would be to solve the constraint equation (E.1) and thus express x2 as a function of x1 in the form x2 = h(x1). This can then be substituted into f(x1, x2) to give a function of x1 alone of the form f(x1, h(x1)). The maximum with respect to x1 could then be found by differentiation in the usual way, to give the stationary value x\u22c6 1, with the corresponding value of x2 given by x\u22c6 2 = h(x\u22c6 1). One problem with this approach is that it may be dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd an analytic solution of the constraint equation that allows x2 to be expressed as an explicit func- tion of x1. Also, this approach treats x1 and x2 differently and so spoils the natural symmetry between these variables. A more elegant, and often simpler, approach is based on the introduction of a parameter \u03bb called a Lagrange multiplier. We shall motivate this technique from a geometrical perspective.

We \ufb01rst note that at any point on the constraint surface the gradient \u2207g(x) of the constraint function will be orthogonal to the surface. To see this, consider a point x that lies on the constraint surface, and consider a nearby point x + \u03f5 that also lies on the surface. If we make a Taylor expansion around x, we have g(x + \u03f5) \u2243g(x) + \u03f5T\u2207g(x). (E.2) Because both x and x+\u03f5 lie on the constraint surface, we have g(x) = g(x+\u03f5) and hence \u03f5T\u2207g(x) \u22430. In the limit \u2225\u03f5\u2225\u21920 we have \u03f5T\u2207g(x) = 0, and because \u03f5 is 707",

    "text": "708 E. LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS Figure E.1 A geometrical picture of the technique of La- grange multipliers in which we seek to maximize a function f(x), subject to the constraint g(x) = 0. If x is D dimensional, the constraint g(x) = 0 cor- responds to a subspace of dimensionality D \u22121, indicated by the red curve. The problem can be solved by optimizing the Lagrangian function L(x, \u03bb) = f(x) + \u03bbg(x). \u2207f(x) \u2207g(x) xA g(x) = 0 then parallel to the constraint surface g(x) = 0, we see that the vector \u2207g is normal to the surface. Next we seek a point x\u22c6on the constraint surface such that f(x) is maximized. Such a point must have the property that the vector \u2207f(x) is also orthogonal to the constraint surface, as illustrated in Figure E.1, because otherwise we could increase the value of f(x) by moving a short distance along the constraint surface. Thus \u2207f and \u2207g are parallel (or anti-parallel) vectors, and so there must exist a parameter \u03bb such that \u2207f + \u03bb\u2207g = 0 (E.3) where \u03bb \u0338= 0 is known as a Lagrange multiplier. Note that \u03bb can have either sign. At this point, it is convenient to introduce the Lagrangian function de\ufb01ned by L(x, \u03bb) \u2261f(x) + \u03bbg(x). (E.4) The constrained stationarity condition (E.3) is obtained by setting \u2207xL = 0. Fur- thermore, the condition \u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = 0 leads to the constraint equation g(x) = 0. Thus to \ufb01nd the maximum of a function f(x) subject to the constraint g(x) = 0, we de\ufb01ne the Lagrangian function given by (E.4) and we then \ufb01nd the stationary point of L(x, \u03bb) with respect to both x and \u03bb. For a D-dimensional vector x, this gives D +1 equations that determine both the stationary point x\u22c6and the value of \u03bb. If we are only interested in x\u22c6, then we can eliminate \u03bb from the stationarity equa- tions without needing to \ufb01nd its value (hence the term \u2018undetermined multiplier\u2019). As a simple example, suppose we wish to \ufb01nd the stationary point of the function f(x1, x2) = 1 \u2212x2 1 \u2212x2 2 subject to the constraint g(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 \u22121 = 0, as illustrated in Figure E.2. The corresponding Lagrangian function is given by L(x, \u03bb) = 1 \u2212x2 1 \u2212x2 2 + \u03bb(x1 + x2 \u22121). (E.5) The conditions for this Lagrangian to be stationary with respect to x1, x2, and \u03bb give the following coupled equations: \u22122x1 + \u03bb = 0 (E.6) \u22122x2 + \u03bb = 0 (E.7) x1 + x2 \u22121 = 0.

LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS 709 Figure E.2 A simple example of the use of Lagrange multipli- ers in which the aim is to maximize f(x1, x2) = 1 \u2212x2 1 \u2212x2 2 subject to the constraint g(x1, x2) = 0 where g(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 \u22121. The circles show contours of the function f(x1, x2), and the diagonal line shows the constraint surface g(x1, x2) = 0. g(x1, x2) = 0 x1 x2 (x\u22c6 1, x\u22c6 2) Solution of these equations then gives the stationary point as (x\u22c6 1, x\u22c6 2) = ( 1 2, 1 2), and the corresponding value for the Lagrange multiplier is \u03bb = 1. So far, we have considered the problem of maximizing a function subject to an equality constraint of the form g(x) = 0. We now consider the problem of maxi- mizing f(x) subject to an inequality constraint of the form g(x) \u2a7e0, as illustrated in Figure E.3. There are now two kinds of solution possible, according to whether the con- strained stationary point lies in the region where g(x) > 0, in which case the con- straint is inactive, or whether it lies on the boundary g(x) = 0, in which case the constraint is said to be active. In the former case, the function g(x) plays no role and so the stationary condition is simply \u2207f(x) = 0. This again corresponds to a stationary point of the Lagrange function (E.4) but this time with \u03bb = 0. The latter case, where the solution lies on the boundary, is analogous to the equality con- straint discussed previously and corresponds to a stationary point of the Lagrange function (E.4) with \u03bb \u0338= 0. Now, however, the sign of the Lagrange multiplier is crucial, because the function f(x) will only be at a maximum if its gradient is ori- ented away from the region g(x) > 0, as illustrated in Figure E.3. We therefore have \u2207f(x) = \u2212\u03bb\u2207g(x) for some value of \u03bb > 0. For either of these two cases, the product \u03bbg(x) = 0. Thus the solution to the Figure E.3 Illustration of the problem of maximizing f(x) subject to the inequality constraint g(x) \u2a7e0. \u2207f(x) \u2207g(x) xA xB g(x) = 0 g(x) > 0",

    "text": "710 E. LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS problem of maximizing f(x) subject to g(x) \u2a7e0 is obtained by optimizing the Lagrange function (E.4) with respect to x and \u03bb subject to the conditions g(x) \u2a7e 0 (E.9) \u03bb \u2a7e 0 (E.10) \u03bbg(x) = 0 (E.11) These are known as the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions (Karush, 1939; Kuhn and Tucker, 1951). Note that if we wish to minimize (rather than maximize) the function f(x) sub- ject to an inequality constraint g(x) \u2a7e0, then we minimize the Lagrangian function L(x, \u03bb) = f(x) \u2212\u03bbg(x) with respect to x, again subject to \u03bb \u2a7e0. Finally, it is straightforward to extend the technique of Lagrange multipliers to the case of multiple equality and inequality constraints. Suppose we wish to maxi- mize f(x) subject to gj(x) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , J, and hk(x) \u2a7e0 for k = 1, . . . , K. We then introduce Lagrange multipliers {\u03bbj} and {\u00b5k}, and then optimize the La- grangian function given by L(x, {\u03bbj}, {\u00b5k}) = f(x) + J \u0002 j=1 \u03bbjgj(x) + K \u0002 k=1 \u00b5khk(x) (E.12) subject to \u00b5k \u2a7e0 and \u00b5khk(x) = 0 for k = 1, . . . , K. Extensions to constrained functional derivatives are similarly straightforward. For a more detailed discussion Appendix D of the technique of Lagrange multipliers, see Nocedal and Wright (1999).",
